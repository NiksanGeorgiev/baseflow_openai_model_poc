“One of the best things about working at Baseflow is the amount of trust and support I receive from the company. When starting a new project the question management asks is ‘ _What do you need?’_ and never ‘ _This is how you need to do it!_ ’ That makes it an absolute joy to work at Baseflow.”
- Maurits van Beusekom (Sr. Lead Developer)
## Reasons to join the Baseflow family

### Take responsibility, get freedom
We believe in autonomy, and that people are capable of coming up with their ideas when you create good surroundings. That’s why everyone gets 10% of their time to spend on topics they are interested in, like [open source](https://www.baseflow.com/technology).
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/6041fb8e79a71019d64e24bb_ic__happy.svg)
### Happy people, happy customers
When people are happy, they get the best out of themselves. We believe in the philosophy when you provide the best surroundings in an open, flat organization, they feel welcome and that eventually means the best for the customers as well.

### Holiday and social events
We believe in taking responsibility rather than a strict holiday leave policy. That’s why we don’t work with fixed days, but you can take holiday leave whenever you want. We also organize cool company events regularly.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/6017b3c90b6e1e7c6d5e2a31_ic__clock.svg)
### Working hours
We offer flexible working hours. We have colleagues all over the world in different time zones. If you want to live and work in, for example, Hawaii, feel free to go. Just send some photos to excite us once in a while, and we are good ;)

“From the moment I started at Baseflow, I felt at ease, everybody is super friendly. The culture suits me as well, even when something is going on privately, I can always count on my colleagues. There is just a really chill vibe here.”

## Flutter: What is it?
### Flutter Framework.
Flutter is a popular open-source mobile app development framework created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and the web. Flutter is known for its fast development cycles, native performance, and smooth animations. Additionally, Flutter provides easy-to-use widgets that can be used to build beautiful interfaces. In recent years, Flutter has become one of the most popular mobile app development frameworks in the world. Thanks to its wide range of features and ease of use, Flutter is well-suited for creating cross-platform applications with a single codebase for every platform. 
### Why use Flutter?
Flutter provides developers with powerful frontends that are quickly built on iOS devices. Flutter helps streamline cross-platform application development and delivers consistent user experiences. If you're looking for a mobile app development framework that is fast, responsive and enables you to build beautiful user interfaces, then Flutter is a great choice. Because Flutter is free and open source, it is easy to start. Additionally, because Google backs Flutter, you can be confident that it is a high-quality framework that will continue to be supported and improved.
## The pillars of Flutter.
## Beautiful
Your vision, uncompromised

## Portable
Develop one code, run it everywhere
![Flutter on several devices](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/63077a47f16f89c67bc6b32a_Whatflut2.webp)
## How can you benefit from Flutter?
### One code base
Flutter’s cross-platform capabilities mean that developers can write one codebase and build for iOS, Android, web, and desktop—all from a single codebase. This not only saves time but also allows for code reuse, which further speeds up the development process. Normally, a large bulk of the costs of development come from having to develop for every code base. By developing in Flutter you will only need to develop, test, and maintain one code base which results in a lower cost basis. Additionally, this allows for a quicker time-to-market of your product.
### High performance
Flutters are quick. Our Flutter design supports glitched, crash-free graphics at native speeds on your device. Flutter code uses the world-renowned Dart language allowing compiling 32bit and 64bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android. Flutter apps are fast and responsive because they are compiled directly to native ARM code. This results in apps that feel natural and smooth, just like users expect. Take the speed limiter of your app!
### Hot reload
Flutter’s hot reload feature helps developers quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster by allowing them to develop with the app open. Hot reload also allows for a more collaborative development process as it enables developers to see the impact of their changes almost immediately and reduce time needed to test.
### Easy integration
Our experts are capable of efficiently integrating Flutter into your existing applications. You do not always need to create a new app from scratch or rewrite your code to Flutter.

## Flutter SDK.
The Flutter SDK is a development toolkit that helps you develop high-quality applications for multiple platforms. It includes a Dart compiler, libraries, and tools that enable you to develop faster with hot reload, use a rich set of Flutter widgets, build beautiful user interfaces, access native platform functionality, and integrate with other popular frameworks and libraries.
### Dart Language
Dart is a client-optimized language that is developed by Google. The dart SDK is used to build web, server, and mobile applications. Dart is easy to learn for developers who are already familiar with object-oriented languages such as Java or JavaScript. Additionally, Dart provides a number of features that make it well-suited for mobile app development, such as hot reload and a rich set of libraries and tools.
### Flutter Team
The Flutter team is responsible for the development and maintenance of the Flutter framework. The mission of the Flutter team is to enable developers to build beautiful user interfaces for all platforms using a single codebase. To achieve this, the team is constantly working on improving the Flutter framework and adding new features.
### Flutter Widgets
Flutter widgets are the building blocks of Flutter applications. They are used to create simple yet powerful user interfaces. There are two types of widgets: stateless and stateful. Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed after they have been created. Stateful widgets, on the other hand, can be modified after they have been createdFlutter provides a rich set of Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-style) widgets that can be used to build beautiful user interfaces. Additionally, Flutter's platform-specific UI components make it easy to create applications that look and feel like they are native to their respective platforms.

## This makes .NET cool
### .NET Framework.
Having a single, modern language (C#) to create ASP.NET backends and true native apps for iOS and Android makes .NET very powerful. .NET offers many benefits to developers, including a wide variety of programming languages to choose from, a robust set of libraries, and seamless integration with other Microsoft products. In addition, .NET makes it easy to create cross-platform applications that can be deployed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
### Xamarin
Xamarin apps are built using the C# programming language, which offers a number of benefits over traditional Objective-C or Java development. First, C# is a more concise and readable language than either Objective-C or Java, making it easier to develop complex apps. Second, C# is a compiled language, which means that it can be executed more quickly and efficiently than interpreted languages like JavaScript. Finally, C# offers full access to all of the features of the underlying platform, making it possible to create truly native apps. As a result, Xamarin is an increasingly popular choice for mobile app development.

# Reliable & Efficient software with Rust
## A **robust** language well suited for building **powerful** software.
![Xamarin](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/634917764a6db359a10b06c6_rust-logo.webp)
## What is Rust?
### The Rust programming language
Rust is a programming language developed by Mozilla to provide a safer and more reliable alternative to C++. It is designed to be memory-safe, meaning that it will automatically prevent most types of memory-related errors that can occur in other languages. In addition, Rust also offers compile-time checking and type inference, which can help to catch mistakes early on. As a result, Rust has the potential to be more reliable and efficient than other languages. However, it is still relatively new, and it remains to be seen whether or not it will be able to live up to its promise.
### Popular amongst developers
Rust has only been around for a few years but has already made a big splash in the development community. There are many reasons developers choose Rust, but some of the most popular reasons include its safety features, speed, and robustness. Rust is an incredibly safe language, so developers can avoid many common errors that can lead to crashes or data loss. In addition, Rust is much faster than many other languages, making it ideal for resource-intensive applications. Finally, Rust is highly robust, meaning it can handle various tasks without breaking down. As a result, Rust is quickly becoming one of the most popular languages for developers of all skill levels.
## The benefits of Rust
### Efficiency
With Rust, you have the power to control how memory is used. This allows developers extend borrowed references' lifetime which can improve efficiency by reducing number of times allocated and deallocated heap needed in your application. The benefits don't stop there though! These techniques also make it easier for hackers who want access beyond what they're allowed under traditional systems because all pointers remain valid until their corresponding owners return from function calls or even exit program altogether - giving them no chance whatsoever at breaking through security measures built around assumptions about where those variables might go next if left unchecked.
### Fearless concurrency
Rust makes it easy to write programs that are safe in parallel by using lightweight threads. These communicate with each other without needing synchronize their accesses, making possible for the use all available CPUs without running into race conditions or bugs related with concurrency. In addition, Rust allows developers create codes whose performance doesn't decrease due its ability handle many tasks at once while preventing any kind chaos like what might happen if multiple code modules tried doing something simultaneously--such as accessing shared data structures
### Safety
The safety features of Rust allow you to write code that is correct and reliable. The compiler catches errors otherwise resulting in undefined behavior, such as dangling pointers or buffer overflows which guarantee your program will not have any unwanted surprises for the developer when it runs through their tested functions with assumptions made about what could happen if things were done differently than how they were programmed originally

# Dynamic & Interactive web applications with Angular
## A **flexible** framework for building **smoother** applications.
![Xamarin](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/636957d841d1b3f27c6b0811_angular.svg)
## What is Angular?
### The Angular development framework
Angular is a development framework for building web applications. The framework is developed and maintained by Google. Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework. The framework makes it easy to develop front-end applications. It also helps improve the performance of those applications. Angular uses a component-based architecture. This means an application is divided into small components, each with a specific purpose. This makes it easier to develop and maintain large applications. Angular also uses a declarative programming paradigm. This makes code more readable and easier to understand. The framework also includes several tools that make developing and testing Angular applications easier.
### Feature-rich
Angular applications are built using TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript that provides static type checking and other benefits. This can help to make your code more maintainable and error-free. Angular is a large and feature-rich framework, it provides many built-in tools and features that can save you time and effort. Whether you're looking to create a simple single-page application or a complex enterprise-level app, Angular is a great choice.
## Why you should use Angular
### Flexibility
A benefit of Angular development is that it allows for a high degree of flexibility. You can use Angular to create single-page applications, or SPAs, web applications that only require one page to load. This makes them much faster and smoother to use than traditional web applications. Additionally, you can also use Angular to create mobile apps.
### Straightforward
One of the benefits of Angular development is that it is straightforward to learn. If you are familiar with HTML and JavaScript, you can pick up Angular products quickly. Additionally, there is a large community of developers who use Angular, which means that there is a lot of support available if you need it.
### Modular
the goal of Angular is to make development and testing easier by modularizing code. This means that Angular developers can use different "modules" for different parts of their APPs, and each module has its own specific functions. This approach makes code more readable and maintainable, as well as more testable. Modularity also allows for better reuse of code, which can save time and effort in the development process. In short, Angular's modularity makes it a more powerful and flexible tool for web developers. Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that allows components to be quickly injected into one another. This makes it easy to create complex applications with a modular structure
### Code testing made easy
Angular has emerged as one of the best frameworks for testing. Thanks to its modularity and dependency injection, Angular makes it easy to create isolated tests that can be run independently of the rest of the codebase. In addition, Angular’s component-based architecture makes it easy to stub out dependencies, allowing tests to focus on a single component without being affected by changes in other parts of the code. As a result, Angular’s features make it an ideal framework for writing high-quality tests.

# Services that will help you accelerate
## Innovation is the **_change_** that brings **_new_** value.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/6013dfab5416bcd926a66c11_img__homepage-scene11-combined.webp)
## Our proposition.
**Baseflow** is a knowledge company: we help with services related to **digital product** development. Our services cover a wide range of disciplines involved with product development: **design** , **strategy** , **development** , management and organization. Innovation is change that brings new value. From our expertise, we help you accelerate. Whether it’s strategy, process, or tech­nology: our consultants help you stream­line your business. We believe that positive change runs together on all levels.
## TaaS
We prefer to work with our **Team-as-a-Service** model (TaaS), which combines the **advantages** of sustainable knowledge with a dedicated, fine-tuned process to **optimize** software development. It ensures the process fits the team and not the other way around: quite often a reason for team underperformance and lack of happiness. For our customers, this model feels like a **partnership** more than a traditional client/customer relationship. In this highly **agile** environment and culture, we can accelerate your digital transformation.

## More convenience and profit in the chain through smart partnerships. To keep moving forward it is important to keep developing, this also applies to Asito. They work in various environments, each of which requires its own approach.

### The problem
Asito's goal is to help their customers by optimizing their processes as well as looking for sustainable solutions.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/60545b41dded3912a7cdf3fc_ic__check_spark.svg)
### Our solution
Asito wanted to develop a facility management tool that provides greater convenience and efficiency, cost savings, and higher customer- and employee satisfaction. The result is a completely new product “OneGo”; a flexible platform, suitable for every sector.
## About
### Best cleaning company
It is not without reason that Asito has been voted the best-rated cleaning company for years in a row, as a result of the Blauw Research study. Asito is a reliable partner in the field of facility services for offices, healthcare institutions, schools, transport, and recreation.

### Connection
Continuous improvement in the processes is an important part of strengthening their core product as well as their position in the markets where they compete.

"With Baseflow we work as one team. Together we determine where we’re going, and that approach suits us very well. They don’t just develop but also think along on a strategic level. I couldn’t be happier"
Wouter Arkink (Manager Business Development, Asito)
## **Approach**
### Cooperation
Asito was looking for a partner to design and develop a new core product. At Baseflow we work very agile, everything happens in small steps. We believe great products arise when not everything is being laid down in advance.
‍

### Continuous strengthening
Continuously validating product use cases, together with the end users, is key. This was a perfect fit for Asito. With a released product, we still come together every two weeks to continue developing the product.

## **Result**
### OneGo
OneGo is a digital service platform that can link facility tasks to the right person. The platform is suitable for collaboration between different facility parties so that everyone can benefit from smart and efficient working.
The platform helps create the most efficient and smart ecosystem among all facility services in buildings.
* Location-based issues can be reported.
* Tasks can be triggered.
* Tasks can be scheduled.
* Tasks can be assigned to someone.
* All steps are fully traceable.

### Used by various organizations
‍
### Schiphol
Schiphol uses the platform to determine the exact location of, and assign a cleaning task to, a person who has time to clean up as quickly as possible. For example, think about a broken window somewhere at the airport that needs immediate attention. Efficiency and customer satisfaction are paramount here.
### Droomparken
Droomparken uses the platform to schedule fully automated house cleaning. For each house, a notification can be created, with different tasks. For example, the task of cleaning the house and the task of checking the cleaning. They save an enormous amount of time and money with this platform, they are very satisfied.

### The problem
In the field of data transfer platforms, the current range of platforms has a limit to the transfer of files. After this, a subscription is required, which is not suitable for everyone. This could be better and slimmer.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/60545b41dded3912a7cdf3fc_ic__check_spark.svg)
### Our solution
The result is Binsend, a file management, and work­flow tool, where file sending is an efficient and easy way with a focus on receiving instead of sending the files.
## About
### Made for businesses
Binsend is a cloud-based, file-sharing platform, focused on the B2B market where document sharing between companies happens several times a day. Everyone can use the tool but the focus is mainly on accountants and mortgage lenders. Among these target audiences, file sharing is an important part of their core business.

### **Goal**
The goal was to simplify the processes of file sharing, focused on target groups for whom file sharing is part of their core business. It had to be a simple, easy and efficient process where the workflow is fully automated.

“At Binsend, we want to relieve our customers in their everyday workflows. We don't assume what is best for our customers, but work together, as partners. This helps us validate the success of existing implementations and shape new ideas that match our customers' vision.”
Thomas Luijken, co-founder Binsend
## **Approach**

## Stabilizing official Google Flutter plugins and taking them to the next level.

### The problem
Google created 15 Flutter plugins as proof of concept. As Flutter was becoming more popular, these plugins were becoming too popular: Google got complaints about the quality of their plugins and was faced with a choice of whether to pull the plug or develop them further.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/60545b41dded3912a7cdf3fc_ic__check_spark.svg)
### Our solution
This is where Baseflow came in. Baseflow worked on taking those pre-existing plugins to the next stable level. This involved bug fixes, adding features, and converting plugins to sound architecture. We have achieved to stabilize these plugins and brought their quality to the next level.
## About
### Google
Google is the creator of the Flutter open-source framework for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. Flutter is used in many large projects, including projects by: BMW, Google Pay, Alibaba Group, and Tencent.

### Flutter
Google supports flutter and is open to everyone. Flutter is characterized by its global open-source community wherein developers collaborate on the open-source framework, contribute to the ecosystem, and help other developers when needed.

“We've experienced that Baseflow is able to deliver the quality that Google demands.”
Tim Sneath (Senior Director, Google)
## **Approach**
### Collaboration between the Google Flutter team and Baseflow
Together with the Google Flutter team, we analyzed every plugin stepwise to see which issues had to be solved to call a plugin stable'. We made a list of topics for each plugin and prioritized these issues with Google. In addition, Google and Baseflow were in weekly contact to discuss the status, progress, and any problems during the stabilization process.

### Flutter ecosystem
Taking these plugins to the next level involved bug fixes, adding features, and converting to a stable architecture. A Flutter plugin bridges the native operating system and the Flutter ecosystem. To bring these plugins to the next level, we have written native code to make the standard APIs available in Flutter and its development language, Dart.

## **Result**
### Successful collaboration
After working with Google for the better part of a year and a half, we proudly announce that the project was a huge success. Due to the close and intensive collaboration with the Google Engineering Group and the in-house Flutter expertise of Baseflow, the Flutter plugins were successfully brought to the next level.

### Popular plugins
The project was to expand further on the Flutter plugins made by Google. The most popular plugins that we have worked on during this project were:Camera: Allows you to integrate camera functionality into your flutter appIn_app_purchase: Allows you to integrate app purchase functionality into your flutter app.Quick_actions: Allows you to add quick actions to your flutter app.Webview_flutter: Allows you to display web pages in your flutter app.Image_picker: Allows app developers to allow users to select an image from their photo library.Local_auth: Allows flutter developers to access biometric sensors - face id - thumb scanner.

## Discover Amigo, a new car sharing service with a streamlined user-friendly app wherein you can share your Amigo lease car with your amigo's. Everything is controlled through the app and the costs are automatically divided. This way you can get on the road without hassle.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/608a7545d6d8e7a4db9dc2d9_ic__exclamation_mark_burst.svg)
### The problem
Not everyone has the luxury of a car, but they do want to experience the convenience of it. Cars are expensive and often stand still. Shared mobility like shared scooters and mopeds are already an emerging trend in big cities.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/60545b41dded3912a7cdf3fc_ic__check_spark.svg)
### Our solution
But there is something new in town! Louwman Group created the ‘Amigo social network’. A concept where it is possible to use a car completely unburdened with a number of friends, family, neighbors or other acquaintances. And the best part, the monthly costs are divided and based on actual usage.
## About
### Amigo
Louwman Group, founded in 1923, is a Dutch family business that has been one of the largest car distributors in Europe for almost 100 years. They are also active in retail, lease & financing, logistics and healthcare.
Amigo is the new car sharing concept of Louwman. Your own car, as with a private lease, combined with the advantages of carsharing. They have set up a sharing concept that significantly increases the use per car.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63567a3c57c4a552a6d8549f_feature-image.webp)
### Goals
With this concept, car sharing becomes accessible to many interested people who currently do not have a suitable sharing solution at their disposal. An important part of the product is the app. With the app you cannot only see where your car is, and make reservations, it also replaces your car keys to actually open and close the car. Baseflow was asked to develop this app and its underlying platform.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63567a41d0e76d3bc59a0669_Amigo-beach%20\(6\).webp)
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/635676bb2d7070ceda5586e9_60c1dc4c63a44a0a24ee0799_img__aimee_de_vries_1.webp)
“My standard is to be in control, but with Baseflow I feel I can let loose. I trust them completely and I am beyond positive. The clear communication, commitment and involvement is something that you don’t see a lot. Many companies can take an example from this.”
Aimée de Vries (business developer New Mobility at Louwman Group and founder Amigo)
## **Approach**
### Agile
To get a clear and shared vision on the goal of this new product we started by organizing several workshops. Amigo explained the customer journeys they already mapped out so far, and we showed them the Baseflow way of working. Also, we shaped the first backlog and overall style guide together to get started.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63567b782d7070810755dac3_1.BaakvanRenesse27-1536x1024.jpg)
### **People over process**
We find it important to give a clear vision of who we are, how we work and see if we can connect with each other. We believe great things can be created when working closely together with the customer as one team. So, we do not work “for” a customer, but rather “with” the customer.
The collaboration is holistic and both parties are very satisfied so far.

## **Result**
### **A cohesive product**
The result is an efficient app that provides everything you need to drive a car. In the app you can make car reservations, get an overview of your previous trips and always have a clear view on your costs so far. Also you do not need a physical key anymore, because the app also acts as your car keys. Just press the start button and go wherever you want!

### The problem
Marriott's existing app by Transendent Maintenance needed an updated architecture and additional functionalities. Moreover, the maintenance platform needed expanding and the overall roadmap had to be refined. As the internal development team did not have the proper knowledge and resources to solve these challenges, they asked Baseflow to advise on this project. 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/60545b41dded3912a7cdf3fc_ic__check_spark.svg)
### Our solution
Our experienced developers worked with the internal development team to transform the native app teams, lead and train their development teams, build their maintenance platform and support the product team to refine their roadmap.
## About
### Marriott, Comcast (USA)

“Our cooperation has enabled us to deliver faster, with better quality. We love working together with Baseflow”
Jerimi Ford (CTO)
## **Approach**
### Agile Collaboration
We have worked together with the Marriott team using the agile methodology. The Marriott development team did not have experience working in agile environments; however, as Baseflow is an expert in agile working, we took the lead on this and coached the team on how to work in an agile environment effectively and the benefits that come with it. The result was that the overall communication improved immensely, roadmaps were made clear, and the overall predictability of the team output increased extensively.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/636927fbd433861d6dae31ee_flutter1.webp)
### MvvmCross Integration
We used Xamarin forms and MvvmCross to optimize the usage of the cross-platform framework. We worked with the development team to achieve a great fit between the data layer, the business layer, and the UI layer of the system. We have made these layers work independently from each other so that they are better maintainable. 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63692bc035a2aa85d829b868_IMGP5556.webp)
## **Result**
### True Partnership
A true partnership was formed, which was deemed incredibly successful by both sides. The combination of clear communication and passion for the project resulted in effective collaboration. The Marriott and Baseflow team learned from each other through extensive knowledge exchange sessions and worked together to lift the app to a higher level.

More information
## https://www.voortman.net/nl/
## The Voortman plate sorter is an advanced machine designed for sorting and handling steel plates in a highly efficient manner. It automates the process of sorting and organizing steel plates for assembly, which was previously a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/608a7545d6d8e7a4db9dc2d9_ic__exclamation_mark_burst.svg)
### The problem
The challenge that Voortman faced was that the output planning for large steel constructions, that consist of many small parts for assembly, was not going as precise as they would like.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/60545b41dded3912a7cdf3fc_ic__check_spark.svg)
### Our solution
We developed a customized SCADA solution for the plate sorter for Voortman. With its smart layer, the Voortman plate sorter coordinates the entire process, determining when a task needs to be performed and verifying all conditions before executing it. This SCADA solution is paired with a Human Machine Interface (HMI) solution to provide a seamless and easy-to-use experience for operators.

## **Approach**
### Even architecture
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm that focuses on building applications around events, which are notifications or messages triggered by specific occurrences or activities. 
EDA is based on the idea that every system and process generates events that need to be processed and acted upon in real-time. EDA allows applications to be highly decoupled, meaning they can operate independently, which provides greater flexibility and scalability
In an EDA system, events are captured, processed, and responded to by individual components or microservices. This creates a highly modular architecture that can be easily extended and modified. By decoupling the application components, EDA enables developers to build more flexible and scalable systems that can respond quickly to changing requirements. EDA is particularly useful for complex applications where multiple components need to interact with each other in real-time.

### Microservice architecture
Microservice architecture is a software design pattern that emphasizes building applications as a collection of small, independent services, each with a specific function. The idea behind microservices is to break down complex applications into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
One of the most significant benefits of microservice architecture is its inherent scalability. By breaking down an application into smaller, independent services, it becomes easier to scale each service individually, rather than scaling the entire application as a whole. This allows for a more efficient use of resources, reducing costs while simultaneously improving performance.

## **Result**
### Plate sorter
The Voortman plate sorter is a highly innovative machine that helps businesses in the steel industry to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. It is an excellent example of how advanced technology can be used to solve real-world problems and optimize industrial processes.

More information
## https://wegocarsharing.com/en/
## Change the world for the better with technology. There are still big climate problems and there are a lot of people and companies who all try to contribute in their own way. We believe that every bit helps.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/608a7545d6d8e7a4db9dc2d9_ic__exclamation_mark_burst.svg)
### The problem
Carsharing is becoming more popular every day. The goal of WeGo is to increase the occupancy rate of vehicles and contribute to improving society by reducing worldwide car emissions.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6005500917c6de66daae5341/60545b41dded3912a7cdf3fc_ic__check_spark.svg)
### Our solution
A seamless booking and driving experience with an app for end-users to make it easy for businesses to get the most out of their mobility fleets. 
## About
### From ownership to user
WeGo is making a material contribution to the shift from vehicle ownership to vehicle use. They aim to increase the sharing of vehicles between multiple drivers, and they support the automotive sector to respond to this shift, focusing on the end-users in various sectors.
‍

### WeGo want to ensure that usability will be increased, so that businesses could:
  * Get a higher utilization from all mobility assets
  * Make a better use of existing fleets
  * Help to shrink the size of some fleets
  * Create a secure digital record of drive times (this helps both the fleet master and the driver for a digital logbook solution)

"We are extremely happy with Baseflow as our platform partner. Their work on our product has enabled us to execute our strategy"
Peter de Jong (CEO, Wego)
## **Approach**
### A dedicated team
The challenges were;
  * That it had to be integrated with an existing Bluetooth technology base.
  * That it was easily adaptable and human-friendly.
  * That it had to be rolled out within three months.


Because of this, we created a dedicated team and used the agile approach which works especially well when the project has a tight deadline.

### Equal motivations
WeGo found a partner in Baseflow as the same motivations drive them. We both try to change the world for the better with technology and help people.

## **Result**
### User experience
A beautiful app made with Flutter with logical user experience. A car-shared platform that helps you show your location and where your car is located. 
The app can create and view bookings, facilitate payment, locate the car and unlock it. From start to finish the app takes care of both the user and the fleet manager.

### Results WeGo
‍
  * Immediate increase in downloads on the app store
  * Improved ratings
  * A lot of positive comments on Facebook. 


Overall they were thrilled with the end product and how we worked together. After the first 3-months, we kept expanding the app with more features that tie into their goals.

# Backend Developer
# Work on the API's
## If you are that type of person that likes working on the fundamentals of a digital product, creating scalable systems with beautiful API's (yes, that is possible), and work closely with frontend devs then look no further.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6041ef652acbafec93bba5e0_img__code_screen.jpg)
For Baseflow’s continuous expansion we are looking for enthusiastic backend developers that are interested in:
  * Working in a diverse team
  * Building beautiful API’s
  * Sharing your ideas about the best backend architectures at the coffee machine
  * The latest .NET Core developments
  * The cloud buzzword, but especially Docker, Azure, Google Cloud, and more of that 
  * Making a bridge between (back-end) technologies and customer functionality
  * Trying out new stuff. It is part of our DNA
  * Helping out customers on consultancy base that (try to) do backends themselves


If you think you are up for the challenge, then at least you need to:
  * Be interested and/or passionate about open source projects
  * Not be scared by SQL, Linux, command line stuff, and customers ;-)
  * Be interested in new stuff. Did we already mention that
  * Like teamwork
  * Be open-minded
  * Like the idea of sharing knowledge (both internally and externally)
  * Feel comfortable with non-hierarchical organizations
  * Live in the Netherlands

# Front-end Developer
# Create amazing UI’s
## Are you an experienced front-end developer that is interested in Flutter but did not go beyond the proverbial ‘hello world’? Then this might be for you! 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/605c5bbf3a02fe7b6f7d7555_img__frontend_setup.jpg)
Baseflow is recognized worldwide for its Flutter knowledge. Not only do we use Flutter for most of our apps, but we also actively contribute to the ever-growing Flutter ecosystem with our open source work.
For Baseflow’s expanding team we are looking for enthusiastic front-end developers that are interested in:
  * Working with some of the brightest Flutter minds to learn from
  * Building great apps for customers
  * Helping out customers on consultancy base that are (try to) doing Flutter themselves 
  * Low-level stuff like Flutter plugins or the Flutter platform itself 


If you think you are up to the challenge then at least you need to:
  * Be interested in new stuff, especially Flutter 
  * Have (some) experience with other front-end technologies
  * Not be scared to ‘learn on the job’
  * Be interested and/or passionate about open source projects
  * Like teamwork
  * Be open-minded
  * Like the idea of sharing knowledge (both internally and externally)
  * Feel comfortable with non-hierarchical organizations


We offer you an environment where you can continuously learn and grow. Our people-first strategy is based on the simple idea that success begins with happy people.

Actually, it is not :-) 
Our people-first strategy is just about that: placing people above process, role, and CV. That means that we are continuously looking for talented people that want to contribute to the Baseflow journey and are looking for an inspiring environment to grow and excel. 
If you are that person and you think you at least match the following criteria:
  * Like teamwork
  * Be open-minded
  * Value diversity
  * Like the idea of sharing knowledge
  * Feel comfortable with non-hierarchical organizations
  * Like to pioneer


Then we are looking forward to hearing about your journey!

# 5 Years of Baseflow
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/646335d6b518709fa45b21a7_DSC00308-2%20final%20cropped%20\(1\).jpg)
## Today is Baseflow’s 5th anniversary!
We’re not very good at celebrating our successes: always busy, always working on the next subsequent success. But we’re going to celebrate this one: with the team, we will visit Berlin next month to celebrate our 5th anniversary. And, of course, we have a pleasant surprise for our valued customers.
But it is also time to reflect on the past 5 years. Or, 6, because the preparation took almost a year. We had a solid plan. And a solid belief in what we wanted to achieve: an organization about people, not revenue maximization. An organization that provides an environment in which people can thrive, be themselves, and grow. Both professionally and personally. And have fun while doing so.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/646339d487fffe29c103b437_IMGP5839%20\(2\).jpg)
I’ve never could have dreamt it would turn out into what Baseflow is today: a diverse team of talented, skilled, and passionate people that are capable of designing and engineering excellent digital products. It is a humbling experience to work with all these people on a daily basis. And while I don’t want to pride ourselves, I truly believe our team is the best.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64633aa156798eaf94c796af_GIJS6012-Edit%20\(5\)%20\(1\).jpg)
So a big ‘Thank You’ to our valued customers who trust us in doing “the right thing.” Day in, day out. Always with a mindset to do best for our customers.
I also like to thank my fellow members of the Baseflow leadership team: Baseflow is genuinely a team effort. And that requires hard work and dedication. Sometimes with struggles, most of the time with joy and excitement. 
But the most enormous thanks is to the team, of course. It is a pleasure working with you all, and I can’t wait to see what we will do next.

## Sometimes, ideas can strike in very odd ways. We want to share with you the entire process of creating an app from start to finish and all the bits that happen even after you think you've finished.
We wanted to share with you the inspiration for the new product we are developing. Sometimes, ideas strike us in very odd ways. We wanted to share with you the entire process of creating an app from start to finish and all the bits that happen even after you think you've finished. 
In this series of blog posts, I will share everything, the good, the bad and the ugly, when it comes to working on developing an app. Where I can help, I will give as many tips as possible, and of course, show our Baseflow methods of working and problem-solving.
The idea from the app originates from an unlikely source—my brother in law, who is a goat farmer. While farming and technology often collide, this is not an area I had much experience with. I didn't know much about farming or how smallholders operate. But the technologist in me was sure there could be better ways to work.
My brother in law keeps around 2000 goats which he and his team milk twice a day. Besides milking the goats, they also make rounds through the stables and check the health of the animals. When somebody sees an animal that is showing signs of sickness, the animal is diagnosed and, if necessary, treated. Per stable, a logbook written with pen on paper is kept, and every inconsistency is manually logged. My brother in law reads through the notebooks (three stables means three logbooks) to try and get an overview of the current state of his livestock. 
As you can imagine, going through the logbooks manually is quite a time-consuming effort, difficult to monitor the health of individual animals or to discover trends over the livestock. These thoughts swam around in my head. There is room for a digital solution here. 
**Advantages of record-keeping at a farm** ‍
It is crucial to keep data about your livestock.
- Helps in preparing pedigree and history records of animals;
- Helps in analyzing feeding cost and benefits from animal product outputs. Hence helps to formulate economic feeding strategies for optimal productions;
- Helps in the detection of abnormal conditions, or disease status of the herd that leads to a loss in body weight, loss in milk production;
- Helps in finding the commonly occurring diseases in the herd and thus to formulate in time precautionary measures like vaccination and to deworm;
- Assists in overall better supervision and management of the herd;
- To compare the herd performances in different years to determine the amount of profit/loss each year and setting future goals/directions for the farm.
When the farmers and shepherds can digitally record information about the animals at the moment they are walking through the stables; the data can be used to solve the following questions:
Provide a real-time overview of the health status of the livestock; Easily monitor the health status of individual animals; Provide the team with reminders on when and how to treat diagnosed animals.
I know this is not the only application out there that can help farmers. But I wanted to put my spin on it. In fact, there are a lot of applications created by big agricultural companies that offer record-keeping functions. But they are for big organizations and massive operations. I'm interested in sustainability and farming in a way that serves my community. And that's what I want to develop into my app.
**How might we** help smallholders improve their processes **with** a digital platform **so that** farming becomes more sustainable for the community?

This isn't just about building an app. This is about digital innovation. How could I harness technology to improve the experience of smallholders at work, offer solutions that would enhance the welfare of the animals, but most of all, how could I build something that would help make better and more informed decisions about the environment? Creating an app isn't about 'going digital.' It is about finding a solution to a problem that has a rippling impact on the better across the globe. 
Was I going to face resistance from my brother in law and his employees? Employees are often too reluctant to abandon natural methods and learn new applications. The UI design would need to be extremely user-friendly and in a way be familiar in order to have the lowest barriers and highest adoption rates. Or do I build in a set of on-screen instructions or guides? It's an app, so there won't be any training. It would have to be intuitive. 
I need to make it a reality. I knew I could help my brother in law and his goats.
What technology am I going to use to build the app? How easy/difficult was data input going to be? What sort of backend support is needed? What is the final product going to look like? Who else can use it?
I have a lot to think about. Which I have documented, and you can follow my processes in these upcoming blog posts. 
I also learned some things about goats!
Did you know: Goats can be taught their name and come when called. My brother in law names lots of his goats! 
Goats' pupils are rectangular. This means they have excellent vision that stretches for 320 to 340 degrees. The human eye can only see around 160-210 degrees). They don't even have to move their head! 
Goats burp! Goats can frequently be heard burping in the barn.

# Agile Retrospectives: The Power of Continuous Improvement
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/649aa6141276362e13a89e2c_flutter1-_3_%20\(1\).webp)
## An integral part of Agile software development, Agile retrospectives, or 'retro' as they are often termed, are game-changers in the industry.
### What are Agile retrospectives?
Agile retrospectives are recurring meetings that provide teams with an opportunity to reflect on their work. The primary goal of the agile retrospective is to empower teams to control their own development process. It focuses on what worked well, what didn't, and how the team can improve in the next iteration. But what is a retrospective in agile, and how does it function? Let's delve deeper.
The retrospective agile meeting is a dedicated space for teams to discuss their work openly and honestly. A 'retro spective' involves three main stages: gathering insights, discussing them, and deciding on improvements. Importantly, all retrospectives should conclude with action items to drive continuous improvement.
The 'agile retrospectives making good teams great' concept highlights the transformative power of these sessions. By facilitating continuous improvement, agile retrospectives help teams identify potential bottlenecks and devise strategies to overcome them, enhancing productivity and project outcomes.
In the retrospective software development context, Agile retrospectives serve as a tool for inspecting and adapting processes. The 'software retrospective' emphasizes the iterative nature of Agile, focusing on process enhancements to deliver better software products consistently.
In a PI retrospective or Program Increment retrospective, teams can look back at an entire program increment, typically consisting of 4-6 sprints, and analyze their performance. Like the Agile retrospective, the PI retrospective aids in pinpointing areas for improvement and reinforcing successful practices.
The 'retro agile' process allows for open communication and a safe space for teams to express their thoughts and feelings about the project at hand. The agile retro is not just about looking back but also about looking forward, with an emphasis on improvement and growth.
### **Now, how can you optimize your Agile retrospectives? Here are some best practices:**
1. Create a Safe Environment: The retrospective meeting in Agile must encourage open, honest discussions. Ensure a safe space where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts without fear of judgment or repercussions.
2. Focus on Actions: The agile retrospective meeting should conclude with clear, actionable steps. All retrospectives should conclude with specific improvements to implement, thereby driving progress and enhancement.
3. Regularity is Key: Retrospectives in Agile should be regular to maintain the rhythm of continuous improvement. Consistent feedback helps the team to adapt quickly and respond to changes more effectively.
4. Use Retrospective Tools: Many software tools can aid in organizing and conducting retrospectives. Using a dedicated tool can streamline the process, ensuring an effective and productive agile retrospective.
The Agile retrospective, or 'what is a retro' in software development, is an indispensable tool for fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Team retrospectives enable introspection, promote better team dynamics, and, most importantly, empower teams to become self-improving entities.
In conclusion, retrospectives agile approach provides an avenue for teams to reflect, learn, and improve. By making Agile retrospectives a priority, software development teams can harness the power of continuous improvement, making good teams great. The question is no longer 'what is agile retrospective,' but 'how can we make our retrospectives more effective?' The answer lies in the core values and principles of Agile, encapsulated in the iterative, collaborative, and improvement-focused nature of Agile retrospectives.
In an Agile environment, it's easy to understand why retrospectives in Agile, commonly known as Agile retros, are highly valued. They help teams extract lessons from their experiences and apply them to future sprints. This process of retrospection not only fosters a culture of transparency but also ensures continuous learning and development.
However, understanding the Agile retrospective is one thing, and effectively implementing it is another. Therefore, let's take a step further and delve into how to conduct an efficient retrospective meeting in Agile.
### **Step-by-step Guide to Conducting an Agile Retrospective**
#### Step 1: Set the Stage
Setting the stage involves ensuring that the retrospective meeting in Agile begins on a positive note. The facilitator needs to establish an environment of trust, ensuring that everyone feels comfortable sharing their perspectives.
#### Step 2: Gather Data
Here, the team members discuss the past sprint, the challenges they faced, and the successes they achieved. The collection of this data provides a foundation for the rest of the retrospective.
#### Step 3: Generate Insights
With the gathered data, the team now dives into a deep discussion to generate insights. They try to understand why certain things happened and identify patterns or underlying issues.
#### Step 4: Decide What to Do
Post the discussion, the team collaboratively decides on the steps that need to be taken to improve further. This phase is where "all retrospectives should conclude with" a plan of action.
#### Step 5: Close the Retrospective
In the end, the facilitator ensures that everyone is on the same page regarding the decisions and steps that have been planned. They might also request feedback for the retrospective process itself.
Following these steps can guide teams in conducting a fruitful Agile retrospective meeting, enabling them to turn hindrances into opportunities for improvement.
Now, how can you ensure the efficiency of these retrospectives?
### **The Role of Retrospective Tools**
In this digital age, retrospective software development tools can be game-changers. They can be used to collect data, organize thoughts, prioritize issues, and ensure that the action items are followed up. These tools make the process smoother, ensuring maximum productivity during the Agile retrospectives.
However, remember that a tool is only as effective as the person using it. The team should be trained to use the tool effectively, ensuring that it aids the process rather than becoming a distraction. Sometimes a good old whiteboard is better than any tool in existence.
### **Why Agile Retrospectives Make Good Teams Great**
The true potential of Agile retrospectives lies in its ability to bring about change, a transformation. It empowers the team to improve continually, ensuring that the Agile retrospectives make good teams great.
Through consistent retrospectives, Agile teams can ensure that they are not only fixing problems but also enhancing their strengths. This dual approach ensures overall growth and development, leading to improved productivity and better-quality outcomes.
In conclusion, the Agile retrospective is not just a meeting; it's a culture, a mindset. It's about consistently striving for better, about never settling. Whether it's a team retrospective or a PI retrospective, the goal remains the same - continuous improvement.
The next time someone asks, 'what is a retrospective in Agile?', you know it's not just a concept; it's the backbone of Agile. It's what keeps Agile teams moving forward, evolving, and delivering excellence consistently. Remember, it's not about being perfect; it's about being better than you were yesterday. That's the power of Agile retrospectives.

# Another kind of adventure
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/62ff65e92e31dc42adc4f498_60214f3f62c157e79458a82e_Adventure-blog-header-V2.jpeg)
## How planning a company adventure turned into a painful decision.
Earlier this month we informed our team that the company adventure scheduled for that Friday was canceled due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Subsequently, we asked them to work from home in an attempt to prevent infection. 
As a "People First" company, this was a painful decision to make; on the one hand, everyone was looking forward to our quarterly company adventure where we spend quality time together and do fun stuff. On the other hand, everyone supported the decision and showed a very pragmatic attitude towards this new reality. 
As working from home (or wherever you want for that matter) is considered nothing special within Baseflow, this decision was relatively non-invasive and almost 'business as usual.' However, generally speaking. Still, most work hours are spent at the office with an occasional "I'll work from home today." Right now, it's the other way around: everyone is working from home unless there's something that requires someone to be in the office.
And although this doesn't change that much from an operational point of view (except physical meetings at customers), it does require special attention to the people's well being and keeping the team spirits up. What helps is having a modern collaboration tool (we use Slack) that makes it very easy to reach out to each other. But that's not enough: our team coach Odette has created these small and fun interventions that we do daily. From making a photo of your coffee machine to an "MTV Cribs" style video our people share of their homes. You might be thinking that these are not work-related, but that's the whole point: laughing together in these times helps, you should try it out ;-)
We're working with our customers to ensure that we can still work together to deliver our projects, but also, more importantly, checking in on how they are going. How are they being impacted, and what can we offer to try and help them overcome their troubles. And to be clear, I don't mean we're offering a product that is going to fix things magically. I mean that we have an honest conversation, and we are looking at how to effectively manage change, review processes and use technology to do this. The most straightforward and most practical advice we have given was to have virtual standups with teams for 15 minutes for questions from their teams. It allowed people to voice their concerns, and then management had the opportunity to discuss and answer questions. It's a small, simple, and cost-effective activity that has a significant impact on your team. I recommend it to every business. 
Every day, our team surprises me with their creativity, positivity, and dedication to keep work going. I'm incredibly proud of our team in the way they are handling this: reaching out, taking care of each other, and our families and meanwhile helping out customers with our usual quality and commitment. 
**I wish everyone to be safe during these challenging times. Let's take care of each other!**

**Wait.. what's Flutter?**
It's the new mobile app SDK to help developers and designers build modern mobile apps for both iOS and Android.[ https://flutter.io](https://flutter.io)
**And.. what's BLoC pattern?**
BLoC pattern was conceived to allow the reuse of the very same code independently of the platform: web application, mobile application, back-end.[ http://flutterdevs.com/blog/bloc-pattern-in-flutter-part-1/ ](http://flutterdevs.com/blog/bloc-pattern-in-flutter-part-1/)

# Baseflow goes Industrial
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/62ff65ea102fe42c7fd12766_60ed7a0ebb38f84997ad1abb_ant-rozetsky-_qWeqqmpBpU-unsplash.jpeg)
## Going Industrial; a new domain for Baseflow. How we entered the industrial and embedded side of the software industry.
Over the last 4 years, we have been busy building the Baseflow brand to what it is today: a team of awesome people dedicated to helping out our customers with their respective journeys. And although we are a deeply technical company, it is not the state-of-the-art technology that makes the difference. Every day we tell our team that ‘how we operate’ is what matters the most: being highly involved with our customers by understanding their business model, being supportive and proactive. Combined with core values like transparency and honesty, this makes for a successful model that we implement with a growing group of customers. 
During this incredible journey we have often talked about the industrial and embedded side of the software industry: not only do some of the founders (like myself) have a background in industrial automation, but we also strongly feel that our model is perfectly suited for that segment as well. Because the challenges are the same: a continuing and increasing lack of (skilled) people and an ever-accelerating technological innovation. 
This year we have been able to bring this together: Thomas Luijken joined the Baseflow family and with him on board we have a real heavyweight in the industrial space with a large network. And with Voortman Steel Machinery B.V., we have added an innovative and well-known brand in the industry to our ever-growing list of valuable partners.
If you are interested in our model and what this could mean for you and your organization, feel free to contact me.

# Baseflow Inside: Jeroen Weener
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6447958c17e18807e3694952_IMGP5881.jpg)
## "I was searching for an employer who would value me as a person, not just as someone who could produce code."
I am Jeroen Weener, a 27-year-old software engineer passionate about basically anything except traveling. My passion for programming started in the back of the class in fourth grade during my French classes. I was intrigued by the graphical calculator and started to program it. French wasn't my favorite subject, but programming the calculator provided solace for me. I started with simple programs such as tic-tac-toe, then proceeded with graphical 'intense' games such as Memory, and eventually built a program to assist in math, economics, chemistry, and physics.
This program would automatically calculate formula outcomes, draw geometry examples and provide a lookup table for terms. I sold this program to peers for 6 euros during breaks. I devised my own 'anti-piracy' measurements to prevent unpaid redistribution, which actually led to my first real software bug. When providing someone with the program, I entered a code that stored the tangent of a value in memory (the tangent served as some sort of obfuscation of the value). During startup, the code would recalculate the tangent and compare it against the stored value. However, if the user switched the calculator setting between using radians and degrees between receiving the program and running it, the checksum would fail, as the tangent outcome would be different.
My passion for programming grew, and I went on to study Technical Computer Science at the University of Twente in Enschede, followed by a Master's degree in Cybersecurity. During my studies, I also served as a student assistant and taught mathematics in high schools. Between my Bachelor's and Master's, I spent a year as chairman of RoboTeam Twente, coordinating the creation of soccer robots to inspire and educate the next generation in robotics and AI. My journey as a software engineer has been an incredible and challenging experience. The thrill of writing code, debugging, and finding solutions to complex problems drives me to continue to pursue my passion for programming.
Working in Twente is going well. It feels very similar to my hometown Assen in terms of its size. In the east, there's more of a "we" feeling, while in the west, I get the feeling that people are more focused on themselves. Here in Twente, there are many local events and more intimate settings, which I really enjoy.
When it comes to my career as a software engineer, I was searching for an employer who would value me as a person, not just as someone who could produce code. I was searching for a company with its heart in the right place. Baseflow's philosophy aligned perfectly with my own personal values. The company's goal is to provide its employees with a great working environment and to grow not for the sake of growth, but mainly to provide us with new and exciting projects.
To make sure Baseflow's promise was not "too good to be true", I attended one of its Rust Meetups in disguise. By showing up without mentioning that I was applying, I could test the waters and experience the culture without potentially running into recruiter-like conversations. I had a great evening and was awed by the atmosphere the people created together.
My first few months at Baseflow have been great. I am amazed by the level of trust and independence I experience in my days. I feel comfortable joining discussions and meetings and contributing my thoughts. The most important aspects of company culture, in my opinion, are respect, appreciation, and trust. It's important to feel like a person within a company and to be seen as one. The trust to be able to do something and to figure it out on your own is crucial. This is all captured in Baseflow's people-first culture and I am thrilled to be part of it.

# Baseflow Inside: Kevin Pease

## Software development is not only a technical process, there is also a mental aspect involved.
**The mental aspect of software development**
**‍** When I started the Associate's Degree in Software Development at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences, I was determined to become a capable software developer within a minimum amount of time. I chose this degree well, for we dove straight into the deep end on day one. Before starting this course, I mentally prepared myself for two intense years during which I would learn a great deal about the specifics of software development, thinking that the most significant challenge would lie in understanding complex topics and abstract concepts. I also suspected that my logical and mathematical skills would be tested thoroughly. A few weeks in, I concluded that I was right about all of this, but I also came to an important realization:
The software development process is about more than technical skills and knowledge, especially when dealing with a steep learning curve. There's another less obvious side to it: the mental process.
I struggled with various topics during the first weeks of the course. I had no real programming experience beforehand, so I had difficulty grasping some concepts. I kept telling myself that this feeling of having no idea what I was doing would eventually go away as the months passed and my experience and knowledge grew. Little did I know that I was dead wrong, and I had to adapt my mindset and learning strategy to complete this course.
I grew up with certain moral values and a way of thinking about things. This is a whole topic of debate in itself. Still, the point is that parents, school, and society had taught me that making mistakes is bad, experimenting is undesirable and dangerous, and struggling with something is a sign that maybe you're not up to the task. I took this mindset with me to Saxion, but it also changed profoundly there.
While the contents, concept, and level of the degree are up to par to produce proficient developers, I was lucky to have a couple of teachers who could show me how to approach challenges, solve problems and come up with original ideas. Through them, I learned that it is completely fine to struggle. In fact, it is the essence of developing. The more you fail, the more you learn. If you don't learn, you don't develop yourself. Otherwise, it would be called knowing and doing, right? The process wasn't always easy, but I learned to adopt a growth mindset. I became comfortable being out of my comfort zone. I still feel intimidated by challenges regularly. However, I've experienced that there's no reason to believe that there's no solution for those challenges and that it is absolutely fine if that solution doesn't come from me in the end but from someone else.
Fast forward to December 2022. I found an internship at Baseflow and was eager to continue on my path of becoming even more knowledgeable and skilled in the trade. Still, I was skeptical about the continuation of my personal growth. I was somewhat worried that there wouldn't be room for this aspect during my internship. Those worries have evaporated long since.
As of now, I'm part of a company that highly encourages experimenting. Trying to think outside the box is generally considered a good thing. Taking time for personal interests is expected. Trust and autonomy are considered normal, and there's a complete lack of work floor politics. This is all very compatible with my newly adopted mindset. The path to becoming a software developer (and already being one, for that matter) is challenging. Still, I'm confident that Baseflow presents an excellent environment where people can truly blossom into a (Base)flower.

## Transitioning into a new career field.
Once a recruiter in the tech industry, I decided to switch careers and become a UI/UX designer. It was a challenging and daunting decision but a decision that has ultimately allowed me to tap into my creative side and find greater fulfillment in my work.‍As a recruiter, I spent my days scouring the job market for top talent, conducting interviews, and placing candidates at one of the biggest tech companies in the Netherlands. It was a fast-paced and demanding job, but I loved the thrill of finding the perfect match for a position.‍However, I found myself feeling unfulfilled as time passed. I missed creative outlets. I realized that my true passion was in design and visual arts. So, I decided to take the leap and pursue a career as a UI/UX designer.‍Making the transition from recruiter to UI/UX designer took work. I had to learn new skills, familiarize myself with design software, and build a portfolio from scratch. But the hard work is starting to pay off. ‍After graduating from my design course, I started applying for a job. It did not take long until I stumbled across a company that piqued my interest. They had a very welcoming vibe. The people from this company seemed happy. The job description was unique. They seemed to put people first.‍Where other companies sum up so many demands and requirements, this company left a lot open to interpretation. It made it easier for me to apply since I could openly tell my story. Within 30 minutes, I received an invitation for my first job interview. My jaw dropped.‍The interview process was unlike any I have been through before. In my first interview, they did not fire hundreds of questions at me. They genuinely wanted to get to know me for who I am. I could speak freely, and my nervousness disappeared within the first minute. It was a wonderful experience.‍We discussed skills more in-depth in the second interview. It was a very positive experience again. They were not off to trick me with hard questions. They knew my background. I was a designer at the start of her career, and they treated me like that.‍And so, I got hired at Baseflow.‍After a few months of experience, it has proven to be a great match. Baseflow puts people first. There was no talking about "We might take a big risk hiring you" or "We will make sure you have enough time to prove yourself" It was a warm welcome.‍As a UI/UX designer, I can use my creativity to bring clients' visions to life. I love turning a blank screen into a beautiful and functional website or app that looks great but also serves a purpose. ‍I am grateful for the experience and skills I gained as a recruiter. I am even more thankful for the opportunity Baseflow gave me to follow my passion and become a UI designer. It may have been a challenging journey, but it has been worth it.

# Build apps for every platform with Flutter
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6304de984cba763cb531f206_GIJS7117_3_40.jpg)
## We've been with the Flutter framework since the beginning. I want to tell you why and how you can use it too. 
### What is Flutter?
First, let me explain what Flutter is. It is a framework wherein you can build applications for mobile, desktop and web all natively compiled. You write the code once and compile it to all the different operating systems. Although Microsoft's Xamarin and Facebook's React Native do something similar using different approaches, Flutter is easier to use and performs the best. 
Google, Flutter's creator, believes user experience is central for the success of their framework. They understood that if they wanted Flutter to succeed, they would have to focus on providing a very pleasant experience for their end-user; namely the developer.
### **Step into the future**
Okay, sounds good so far, right? Now let's take a look at the future. Flutter is currently the fastest-growing development framework for software developers and I think it will only grow faster. Flutter is critical to Google's long-term strategy. They are working on a colossal project named Fuchsia, where they develop an entirely new operating system. Flutter plays a significant role in this as the preferred framework to build Fuchsia apps. Also, look at large companies such as Philips, Funda, and Albert Heijn. They all use Flutter as their go-to for developing applications. And the fact that the automotive industry, such as BMW and Toyota, choose Flutter is significant as well because they have a long lifecycle. All new Toyota cars are built with Flutter, meaning every digital aspect you see on your dashboard is made using Flutter. They wouldn't have done it if they saw a risk that it has no future because they can't afford that. 
In addition to the above, there is also an HR component: there is a significant shortage of software developers and that problem is only getting bigger. To hire and retain people, employers must give people the tools they like to use. So it's good for companies to embrace Flutter because it suits their recruitment policy. As a developer, I also see that it works. So much more user-friendly and more straightforward than other techniques, this will continue to grow for the time being and will become even more prominent. I think Flutter has a great future. Mark my words! 
### **Get started**
My first advice would be to start contributing to an open source project. Nothing is more educational for a developer than working in an open source environment, where you will get feedback and opinions from others in the industry. If you have become curious about Flutter due to this article, visit the [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev) website, there you will find a 'getting started guide'. In five minutes they’ll guide you through the process to build a small application working on all platforms. This will give you a feeling for the programming language, Dart. After that, you are all set to get started. And do you have a problem or want to build an app with Flutter, we are happy to help. Feel free to contact us.
Have fun and good luck!

# Cached Network Image package now supported by Baseflow
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60216adf96a479cf60087749_file-cabinets-1370294.png)
## Great news for the Flutter community: CachedNetworkImage joins the existing set of Baseflow packages
Great news for the Flutter community: CachedNetworkImage joins the existing set of Baseflow packages. Why is this excellent news for the community? CachedNetworkImage is one of the most popular packages (it is in the top 10 of Top Flutter Packages). Within Baseflow, we will be able to give better support to the package and add new functionality.
CachedNetworkImage was developed in December 2017 because I needed the functionality for a hobby app, and I needed a basic caching mechanism. As Flutter was still in its early development stages young at that time, there wasn't any image caching mechanisms available other than in memory. I made the library available on open source and published it on pub.dev. Flutter started to mature and grow in popularity, and so did my package. I never anticipated CachedNetworkImage to become so widely used, so to support a bit more than basic caching, I decided to rewrite the whole package at the end of 2018, the start of 2019, just before the number of issues on GitHub would get over my head.
In my professional work, I rarely had the opportunity to work with Flutter; I was always working on hobby projects. This year Baseflow allowed me to work on exciting Flutter apps and spend some time on open source projects. You might already know some of the existing Baseflow packages, such as geolocator and permission_handler. Next to the Flutter packages we also have some very well known Xamarin packages as MvvmCross and the Xamarin Media Manager. So I'm proud that CachedNetworkImage joined a rich suite of open source projects, and I can collaborate with some of the brightest minds.
The backlog of plans for CachedNetworkImage is vast, so the priority is to get the issues, and PRs cleaned up. Next, we will focus on testing and code quality. Only after that, we will focus on new features, such as support beyond Android and iOS.

# ChatGPT vs. Google’s Bard: What are the differences between these two?
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63f60c1b8c4b9d38e08354af_emiliano-vittoriosi-vEN1bsdSjxM-unsplash.jpg)
## How does Google's Bard compare versus ChatGPT? What are the differences between these two?
### Introduction
Language models have become increasingly important in today's digital age, with many companies and organizations relying on them for various applications. Two of the most popular language models are ChatGPT and Google's Bard. In this blog post, we will compare and contrast these two models, examining their similarities and differences in terms of accuracy, language use, responsiveness, and multilingual capabilities. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model, as well as their current and potential future applications.
### Background of ChatGPT and Google's Bard
### Development and training
ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a transformer-based language model that was trained on a massive amount of text data. It is based on the GPT-3 architecture, which has 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest and most advanced language models to date. ChatGPT was trained on a diverse range of text data, including books, articles, and web pages, and is capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant responses.
Google's Bard, on the other hand, is a neural network-based language model that was also trained on large amounts of text data. Bard was trained on a smaller dataset than ChatGPT, but it was specifically designed to be more efficient and lightweight. Bard is capable of generating human-like responses and can adapt to user inputs over time.
### Technical specifications
ChatGPT and Google's Bard differ in their technical specifications. ChatGPT is a transformer-based model that uses a combination of attention mechanisms and positional encodings to generate responses. It is a massive model that requires significant computational resources to run. Google's Bard, on the other hand, is designed to be more lightweight and efficient than ChatGPT, making it better suited for real-time applications.
### Applications
ChatGPT and Google's Bard have a wide range of applications. ChatGPT is primarily used for language generation tasks, such as chatbots, content creation, and text completion. It has also been used for more complex applications, such as language translation and question answering. Google's Bard, on the other hand, is primarily used for chatbots and personal assistants. It is designed to be more responsive and interactive than ChatGPT, making it well-suited for real-time conversations.
### The difference between Google’s Bard and ChatGPT.
While both chatbots have similar capabilities and are designed to mimic human conversation, they differ in the way they are trained. ChatGPT is trained on OpenAI's GPT-3 model, while Bard is trained on Google's internal LaMDA model.
OpenAI's ChatGPT is a large language model that uses deep learning to generate text based on a given input. The model is trained on a massive amount of data from the internet, including books, articles, and websites. This training data allows ChatGPT to understand the nuances of human language and generate responses that are both accurate and contextually relevant.
Google's Bard, on the other hand, is based on Google's LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) technology, which is still in development and not publicly available. LaMDA is designed to understand and generate language in a way that is more similar to how humans communicate. This means that Bard is able to respond to complex queries and provide more nuanced answers than traditional chatbots.
One of the key differences between ChatGPT and Bard is the training data used to create each model. While ChatGPT is trained on a wide range of publicly available data, Bard is trained on Google's internal data. This gives Google a significant advantage in terms of the quality and quantity of data they can use to train their model.
Another difference is in the size and complexity of the two models. ChatGPT is a very large language model with over 175 billion parameters, making it one of the most complex AI models ever created. Bard, on the other hand, is not as large as ChatGPT but is still a highly sophisticated AI model that is capable of processing large amounts of data and providing nuanced responses.
Finally, there are differences in the way that OpenAI and Google approach the development and deployment of their respective chatbots. OpenAI is a research-focused organization that is committed to advancing the state of AI technology and making it accessible to as many people as possible. Google, on the other hand, is a large technology company that has a range of products and services, including cloud computing and search engines, and is focused on delivering value to its customers and shareholders.
Overall, while both ChatGPT and Bard are highly advanced chatbots that are capable of providing valuable assistance and information to users, they differ in several key ways, including their training data, intended use cases, complexity, and approach to development and deployment. As AI technology continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these two chatbots continue to develop and compete with each other in the market.
### The advantages and disadvantages of Google’s Bard and ChatGPT
In this section, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of both Google’s Bard and ChatGPT.
### Advantages of Google's Bard
Real time communication: Google's Bard is capable of communicating through text. This makes it a more versatile tool for businesses and individuals who want to communicate with their customers in different ways.
Possible integration with Google services: Bard, as a Google product, can be tightly integrated with other Google services like Google Maps, Google Search, and Google Assistant. This means that it can provide more accurate and relevant responses to certain queries.
Natural language processing: Bard uses advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries. This makes it a highly effective tool for businesses and individuals who want to automate their customer service and communication processes.
### Disadvantages of Google's Bard
Limited availability: Bard is currently only available to a select group of developers and businesses. This means that it may not be accessible to everyone who wants to use it.
Limited customization: While Bard can be customized to fit the needs of different businesses, its customization options are currently limited.

Limited control over output: ChatGPT is a generative model, which means that it generates responses based on the input it receives. This can sometimes lead to unexpected or unwanted output.
Both ChatGPT and Google's Bard have their advantages and disadvantages. While ChatGPT is highly customizable and capable of generating human-like responses, it has limitations when it comes to domain knowledge and empathy. On the other hand, Bard offers communication and advanced natural language processing, but has limited availability and customization options. Ultimately, the choice between the two chatbots will depend on the specific needs of businesses and individuals.
### Google’s Bard is off to a rough start
Bard's debut wasn't great, it made a factual error in its first demo that damaged the legitimacy of Google’s Bard. The demo showed Bard answering the question, "What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9-year-old about?" Bard said that the telescope took the first pictures of a planet outside our solar system. But some astronomers on Twitter pointed out that this isn't true. The first picture of an exoplanet was taken in 2004, as NASA's website states. Astrophysicist Grant Tremblay tweeted that Bard wasn't right, and Bruce Macintosh, director of University of California Observatories at UC Santa Cruz, also pointed out the mistake.

‍
Alphabet, the company that owns Google, was hurt by the rough public debut of Bard. Shares dropped almost 8% on Wednesday and another 5% on Thursday because people are worried that Bard, might not be very good. The estimated loss in market value is around 100 billion. That sure brings the ‘demo-effect’ to a new high.

However, it requires significant computational resources to run and may not be as responsive or interactive as Bard in real-time applications.
Overall, the choice between ChatGPT and Bard depends on the specific use case and requirements of the user. As AI technology continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these two language models develop and compete with each other in the market.

# Create clarity through a style-guide!
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60216cfa7ebd84e4a94dda1f_landkaart.jpeg)
## Let us show you how adding a style-guide to your app can prevent several issues regarding components in your app. 
Have you ever been building duplicate components? Or have you ever joined a team and wondered which components are available to use? All of these issues could’ve been prevented by adding a style-guide to your app! Let me show you an example of how I’ve done this and why it’ll add value to your projects. A simplified example (Flutter) repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-style-guide).
_Note: The style-guide concept can be applied in any kind of application it’s not only bound to Flutter._
### Why using a style-guide?
By adding a style-guide you’ll make it easier for all team members to implement the pages your designer delivers to you. You are creating a ‘reference’ page that contains every component that has been built so far. It gives you visual, and so clear, insights on what components you, as a developer, have available to work with. Let me show you one of our examples! 
‍
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6023c08109927374a719e007_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif)
‍
As you can see it’ll give you an instant overview of all of the components that developers have available and how to relate these components to the design the designer has delivered. As you can see all the components have their class names shown as titles above the presentation of the component itself. This will prevent the developer from having to dive into the source code of the style-guide page to figure out the exact class name of the component he/she wishes to use.
### Add it at the start of a project 
I would strongly advise adding a style-guide at the start of a project and let it grow as your project grows. This makes it easier as it’ll grow in small bits just like your application does. Plus, it’ll provide you and your team with all of the advantages right from the start. That'll save some time, money, and frustration!
### Keeping it up to date
It’s really important to keep the style-guide up to date because what is the point of the style-guide if it is missing some components? If this is the case the developer might build a duplicate component or he/she still needs to track down the right components by navigating through the app and diving into source-code. A waste of time and money!
But I know this can be tricky and easily forgotten. So that’s why I would advise you to add it to a checklist in your pull request (PR) template. 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60216ef79f28f64a61df1028_pr%20template.png)
And for those who don’t know what PR’s are please read into what it is as it’s one of the most efficient tools to help you maintain high quality code throughout your applications.
### Make it easily accessible
My last tip to you would be to make the style-guide page easily accessible. In most of my projects, I like to make it visible in the hamburger menu. Don’t forget to do this only in debug mode! To give you an example I’ve set up an example (Flutter) repo [here](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-style-guide)._Note: The style-guide concept can be applied in any kind of application it’s not only bound to Flutter._
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6023ce7b3bbcfe99ed64e807_style-guide-eza%20\(1\).gif)

So now you know my solution, I bet there are some improvements to be made. If you know some, please share them with me and we can improve this blog post together! You can also find me on Twitter ([@jop_middelkamp](https://twitter.com/jop_middelkamp)) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jopmiddelkamp) or even by mail to jop@baseflow.com.

# Discovering 10% Time: Where Passion Meets Purpose
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/65096954940045f116493927_austin-pacheco-FtL07GM9Q7Y-unsplash.jpg)
## How Baseflow gave me the opportunity to end up at School's Cool
# A Playground for Passion
Baseflow’ers get to spend 10% of their time to dive into anything their heart desires. This time is used to tinker with cloud detection algorithms, explore uncharted culinary territories, stroll through nature, or sweat it out in the gym. 
During my time at Baseflow, I have started many different projects, of which most never saw the light of day. I honed my lock picking skills, spent time on a Flutter app for fellow vegans, got really into [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), and more recently started my pentesting journey through [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/). In this blog, however, I want to tell you about the 10% project that gives me the most satisfaction out of all of them.
# The Trigger
Ever since I started my career, I have been trying to find my place in society. I want to give my geeky side enough substance to chew on, while also listening to my urge to do good. Working at Baseflow, my geeky side is covered. Together with experts, I am working on high quality software that is used by people all over the world. And within the company, there are many ways in which I can ‘do good’. For example, once a month, my colleagues and I go [Trashpacking](https://trashpackers.org/) on Friday afternoons. 
Still, I wanted to do more. Rewinding to January of this year, I found myself at a conference for schools: [de Nationale Onderwijstentoonstelling](https://www.not-online.nl/). Why? Well, in a previous life, I taught Mathematics in high school, and it seems the teacher within me just refuses to retire. Anyway, part of the reason I was there was to meet Eric van ‘t Zelfde. I knew him from the Dutch TV show [Dream School](https://www.npo3.nl/dream-school/). In the show, he and Lucia Rijker team up with Dutch celebrities to inspire a group of school-leavers to develop themselves and work towards a future with ambition.
# Meeting Eric
Eric’s talk was scheduled at the end of the day. He took us through his experiences as headmaster of several schools. With his pragmatic way of thinking (which got him into trouble from time to time), he turned the worst schools into the best ones within years. Throughout the talk, he knew how to keep the story funny and entertaining, while at the same time not shying away from the terrible things he experienced in this role. 
If you can read Dutch, I highly recommend reading [this item](https://www.interpolis.nl/zakelijk/magazine/welbevinden/crisis-de-baas-interview-hugo-de-groot), in which Eric briefly goes over some of his experiences. Throughout the talk I was in awe. This person made a difference for so many people! On my way home on the train I could not stop thinking about it. I felt inspired and wanted to take action myself. I searched online for voluntary work in Enschede and found many options. I decided to start with something I was familiar with from my teaching years; helping teenagers. I was so hyped I applied before I even got home.
# School’s Cool
And that is how I ended up at [School’s Cool](https://www.schoolscool.nl/). This organization matches volunteers to elementary school students who are on the brink of moving to middle school. These students could use some extra help with the transition for a plethora of possible reasons. 
Mentors help their mentee with anything but the actual school work. This could be creating a schedule, figuring out what they like and do not like in life, opening up and talking about feelings, or just getting a break from the situation at home. School’s Cool is active in several parts of the Netherlands, including Enschede. After applying, I got matched with a student. We meet weekly after school finishes. I use my 10% time at Baseflow to bike to his place, hang out, and bike back. Initially, it was a bit scary for me to be honest, as I could feel responsibility that I had not experienced before. 
However, after meeting my mentee a couple of times we had a great connection. We matched very well together, enjoying geeking out over many things. His family was very welcoming, and soon I felt more than just a mentor. We spent some weeks learning about programming, to the point where he built his very own website using HTML and CSS. We also looked into Rubik’s Cube algorithms, duked it out on the chessboard, talked about whether dinosaurs could have been killed by a meteorite and played soccer in the rain. You should have seen the look on my colleagues’ faces when I returned to the office halfway through the day, soaking wet and smelling like sweat.

# Lessons Learned
This experience has given me, and is still giving me, a sense of purpose and fulfillment. I have learned a great deal about responsibility, setting boundaries and mentorship. All while having loads of fun.
Are you also looking for a way to do good? Try volunteering! You will contribute to society while gaining invaluable skills. If you would like to become a School’s Cool mentor too, feel free to reach out to me, or you can visit <https://www.schoolscool.nl/> for more information.

# Dutch Flutter Meetup success! 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60216aabcff36a18d8940358_IMGP1495.jpg)
## We are always eager to talk about all things Flutter, so we hosted another successful Flutter Meetup in the first week of November.
Baseflow hosted another successful Flutter Meetup in the first week of November. Over 25 people joined the meeting inside the Klooster Dolphia, where members were treated to a delicious dinner, drinks and all-you-can-handle Flutter buffet! 
We are always eager to talk about all things Flutter, so to get a sense of what people wanted to know more about - we took our question to the people! We posted a poll on twitter and it was decided…
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60217b948e855de8c34363c3_Twitter-poll-blog.jpg)
We we're going to talk about Architecting apps using the BLoC Pattern.
**Wait… you are not sure what Flutter is?** It's the new mobile app SDK to help developers and designers build modern mobile apps for both iOS and Android. <https://flutter.io>‍
Maurits van Beusekom one of Baseflow resident Flutter experts, gave an in-depth talk into the benefits and why be prefers Architecting apps using the BLoC Pattern. Baseflow has been very busy building apps for clients using Flutter and are devoted to sharing their knowledge within the community.**BLoC** stands for Business Logic Components. The basic idea of BLoC is that everything in the app should be represented as a stream or a sink event. An input sink can be used by widgets to notify the BLoC of new events. An output stream property can be used by widgets to listen for state changes and create the layout accordingly. BLoC sits in the middle, managing the conversation. Dart even comes with a syntax for working with streams that are based into the language! The best part about this pattern is that you won't need to import any plugins or learn any custom syntax. Flutter already comes with everything you need. Maurits dove right into the architecture and even gave a live technical demonstration. An interesting question was raised during the event: 
**Why use BLoC instead of using Provider?**
In short, Provider in itself doesn't replace the BLoC pattern. However, you can set up your architecture to use Provider in a way that could replace the BLoC pattern. The answer is brief here, but it is something we can explain further in a future blog post. 
We had some cool swag to give away in the shape of stickers and t-shirts. It was well received by the attendees. And that is not all! We've compiled this handy cheat sheet to recap all the important takeaways. [Download it here.](https://storage.googleapis.com/baseflow-website-strapi-storage/8d98080fc8fe4aa2b09de802c84c3c0c/flutter_event_take_aways.pdf)

# End of year 2019
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/62ff65ea885ba15ded65bc85_6023da6d0c710f1880da35a1_End%2520of%2520year%25202019%2520v2.jpeg)
## Reflecting on 2019 and talking about our 'people first' strategy and its foundation: "if you do good for your team, your team will do good for your customer, which in turn is good for your company."
It's that time of the year where you look back and think: "wow, the time has passed quickly!" And yes, we had fun as well :-) It also makes you reflect on the road taken over the last year. Business-wise it was a great year: we've seen serious growth, both in team and revenue. And while growth alone is not our primary goal, it's good to know that we're able to execute and deliver to our customers while also being attractive as an employer.
When we started Baseflow, we built it around the idea of a 'people first' strategy. As founders, we've seen the same story repeated: a lack of understanding of what software development is all about, often resulting in disappointments both business-wise and on a personal level. 
While this phenomenon itself is an interesting subject for a philosophical debate ("is this only happening in the software development industry?") by the coffee machine or better, with some drinks at a bar, I'd like to zoom in a little bit in how we try to avoid this altogether.
Our 'people first' strategy is based on a rather fundamental and simple foundation: "if you do good for your team, your team will do good for your customer, which in turn is good for your company." This strategy sounds somewhat simplified, and in essence, it is. Executing this strategy is an exciting challenge because we're not talking here about "stuff", we're talking about culture. How are we organized, do we communicate and behave to create a working environment in which everyone can excel at what they are doing and be happy.
Happiness is extremely underrated in terms of operational efficiency. I'm still surprised how much this is still considered as 'soft' when talking about managing an organization, while it seems so apparent that happy people are more productive than people who are not. And again, we're not talking about '"stuff" here: you don't make people happy with a PlayStation in the office.
One of the biggest drivers of our culture is autonomy: a sense of freedom and the ability to make decisions by yourself instead of asking a manager for permission. Again, rather obvious, but enabling this in your organization is a real feat. I'm very proud that we, still being a startup, have someone on board who's specifically creating tools and guidelines to work on our culture daily. And this is hard work: right now our culture is not carved in stone, but organically evolves over time. Why are we doing this now and not in 5 years when we've come out of the startup phase? Because in 5 years, the company culture is a fait accompli, and it might be too late to start thinking about it consciously.So yeah, we had one hell of a ride this year! We've achieved a lot, learned a lot, and had a lot of fun. A massive thank you to the team: it's humbling to see such an exceptional group of talented people working together, bearing the responsibility towards our customers, have fun, and challenge each other to shine and excel.
I'd also like to thank our customers that believe in our people and trust us with their business challenges and budgets. "It takes two to tango," but when that happens, it is incredible to see that we can play our part in making our customers successful in their own businesses.
**We would like to express our sincerest appreciation for the trust you have placed in us and best wishes for the holidays and into the New Year. From all of us at Baseflow!**

# End of year retrospective - 2023

## Another year has flown by.
This year a lot has happened at Baseflow. Looking back on a fantastic year, surprise and pride flood my mind. The positive surprise about what we've accomplished this year and pride about how our people have grown and prospered this past year. We've worked together on further growth of the organization and further professionalization of our services. We deepened our relationship with existing customers and started several processes with incredible new customers. And we are far from done!
But the most beautiful thing remains our basis: making cool things with a fantastic group of creative, passionate, and fun people. Sometimes it's that simple ;-)
I want to thank our customers and relations for the pleasant cooperation over the past year - let's continue this in the new year!
Finally, I wish everyone a few lovely days with family and friends!

The Agile Manifesto was written in 2001, and its principles continue to guide software development practices today. Its founders underscored the value of collaboration, delivering working software frequently, and responding to change quickly over following a rigid plan. Agile methodologies have become increasingly popular due to their flexibility and ability to adapt to changing requirements.
Agile methodologies have also given rise to a number of frameworks, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Lean, which have further refined the Agile approach to software development. These frameworks provide teams with a structured approach to Agile development, making it easier to implement and scale Agile practices across an organization.
#### The Emergence of DevOps
DevOps emerged as a response to the growing complexity of software development and the need to deliver software faster and more consistently. Its focus is on delivering software in shorter release cycles through automation and collaboration. DevOps has become an essential part of software development, enabling teams to release software more frequently and with greater reliability.
The adoption of DevOps has also led to the rise of new tools and technologies, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), which have become essential to the DevOps process. These tools enable teams to automate the software delivery pipeline, reducing the risk of errors and enabling faster time-to-market.
Furthermore, the adoption of DevOps has led to a cultural shift in software development, with teams working more collaboratively and breaking down silos between development and operations. This cultural shift has led to greater efficiency and improved communication, enabling teams to deliver software more quickly and with fewer errors.
In conclusion, while Agile and DevOps have evolved independently, they have become increasingly interdependent, with Agile providing the foundation for DevOps and DevOps enabling Agile teams to deliver software more quickly and with greater reliability. The continued evolution of these methodologies will undoubtedly lead to further improvements in software development practices and greater success for software development teams.
### Key Principles of Agile and DevOps
Both Agile and DevOps share several key principles that underpin their respective methodologies. These principles help teams to deliver high-quality software products that meet the needs of their customers.
Agile methodology emphasizes on the following principles:
#### Agile Principles
  * **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:** Agile methodology values people and their interactions more than the tools and processes they use. It emphasizes on teamwork and face-to-face communication to build trust and foster collaboration among team members.
  * **Working software over comprehensive documentation:** Agile methodology prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation. It encourages teams to focus on delivering software that meets the customer's needs, rather than spending time on documentation that may not add value.
  * **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:** Agile methodology values customer collaboration over contract negotiation. It involves the customer in the development process and seeks their feedback to ensure that the software meets their needs.
  * **Responding to change over following a plan:** Agile methodology values responding to change over following a plan. It recognizes that change is inevitable and encourages teams to be flexible and adaptable in response to changing requirements.


DevOps methodology emphasizes on the following principles:
#### DevOps Principles
  * **Collaboration between development and operations teams:** DevOps methodology emphasizes on collaboration between development and operations teams. It seeks to break down the silos between these teams and promote a culture of shared responsibility for the software development lifecycle.
  * **Continuous integration and delivery:** DevOps methodology values continuous integration and delivery. It seeks to automate the software delivery process and ensure that software is delivered to customers quickly and frequently.
  * **Automated testing and deployment:** DevOps methodology emphasizes on automated testing and deployment. It seeks to reduce the risk of human error and ensure that software is tested thoroughly before it is deployed to production.
  * **Monitoring and feedback loops:** DevOps methodology values monitoring and feedback loops. It seeks to gather feedback from customers and stakeholders and use this feedback to improve the software development process.


By following these principles, Agile and DevOps teams can work together to deliver high-quality software products that meet the needs of their customers in a timely and efficient manner.
### How Agile and DevOps Complement Each Other
While Agile and DevOps have different goals and approaches, they complement each other well, especially in development environments that require a high degree of collaboration and change management.
#### Agile's Focus on Flexibility and Collaboration
Agile's iterative and adaptive approach ensures that teams can easily incorporate feedback and changes. This allows them to work effectively and in harmony with DevOps teams, which are traditionally responsible for infrastructure, automated builds, testing, and deployment.
Agile methodologies prioritize flexibility and collaboration, allowing teams to work together and adapt to changes in real-time. This approach encourages continuous improvement and ensures that teams are always working towards the most valuable outcome. By embracing Agile principles, teams can deliver high-quality software that meets the needs of their customers.
One of the key benefits of Agile is its emphasis on customer satisfaction. By prioritizing customer feedback and incorporating it into the development process, teams can ensure that they are delivering software that meets the needs of their users. This approach helps to build trust with customers and can lead to increased loyalty and repeat business.

## What exciting news has been announced at Flutter Forward 2023? Read about it here!
### What is Flutter Forward?
[Flutter](https://www.baseflow.com/technology/flutter) is a popular open-source mobile app development framework created by Google. It is used to develop Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and web applications.
Flutter Forward is Google's official event to set up Flutter's story arcs for the coming years. During this event, many exciting new features were demonstrated that are still works in progress but exciting nonetheless. Flutter Forward was hosted in Nairobi, Kenya, and it is one of the first world-class product launches in East Africa.
### 17 Days of Flutter
The last [17 days](https://flutter.dev/events/flutter-forward#17-days-of-flutter) have been a fantastic rollercoaster for Flutter content. The well-beloved Dash is featured in many adventures, such as [building a game](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-flame-game#0) with Flutter and Flame and being tested on by the community in the [doodle dash challenge](https://flutter.dev/events/doodle-dash-challenge)!

A live Q&A with leaders from Dart, Flutter, and Firebase.
With John Ryan, Developer Relations Engineer for Flutter & Dart, and Kate Lovett, Software Engineer for the Flutter Framework.
### Flutter Forward Keynote Presentation
Tim Sneath, VP of developer relations for Flutter, took the stage to share a few words about this incredible technology. With Flutter, developers can now build web, mobile, and desktop applications with one single codebase. This is made possible through its five core pillars: Beautiful, Fast, Productive, Portable, and Open. It currently has production support for six platforms: Android, IOS, web, windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded. Now with over 5 million flutter developers who have experienced the technology and 700k+ apps launched using it makes, it is one of the top 3 projects on GitHub by contributors.
Flutter 3.7 has brought with it many exciting new features! It offers enhanced support for Material 3, enabling developers to craft beautiful user interfaces. With Adaptive Layout, apps can automatically adjust their layout to fit any device size. Users can now access menu bars and cascading menus for all sorts of UI customizations. Impeller preview is also available in iOS versions of the app, and a new tool allows for validation upon release for iOS apps. Finally, DevTools have been improved with several updates and improvements.
At the Flutter + Firebase section, Eric Windmill talked about how to build authentication into an App using Firebase. This is made easy through Firebase, which enables developers to quickly and efficiently implement auth in Flutter. 
Abel Mengistu from [Flutterflow](https://flutterflow.io) took the stage and showed developers how to quickly and easily create applications with Flutter. Flutterflow offers integrations that simplify building apps with a few clicks, eliminating the need for tedious coding. Moreover, its generated code is extremely clean and easy to read, ensuring users can start creating their apps immediately.
In the second half of 2020, the[ PUBG mobile team](https://www.pubgmobile.com/en-US/home.shtml) sought a cross-platform framework to handle their in-game communication module needs. After some research, they realized that Flutter would provide them with the performance they needed and the ease of use offered by Dart made it a perfect fit. With Flutter, they quickly got up and running on their app project and have seen success ever since.
Google has embraced the power of Flutter for many of its app-building needs. Notable apps, such as [Google Classroom](https://edu.google.com/workspace-for-education/classroom/) and other educational tools, have seen massive leaps in user engagement with Flutter's help. Product Manager Sofie Cornelis cites the ability to share 98% of code between platforms, reduce code size by 66%, and use hot reloads that reduce update time from minutes to seconds as key factors for their high growth rate.
Michael Thomsen announced and discussed the powerful features of Dart 3a. New language features such as records and patterns make Dart more responsive, with a new type of built-in collection able to return multiple types. Sound Null safety provides better trust between compilers and types, allowing for faster code that is now down to only three instructions in Dart 3 compared to 26 in Dart 1. High portability is also strengthened with experimental support for [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/). We expect Dart 3 stable to launch later this year.
Tim Sneath further discussed Flutter Web and its implementation with CanvasKit and WebAssembly. Unlike general-purpose frameworks such as [Angular](https://www.baseflow.com/technology/angular) or [React](https://www.baseflow.com/blogs/flutter-vs-react-native-which-framework-should-you-use-in-2023), Flutter is architecturally designed around these new standards. It provides a great example of this in the form of the Rive editor, which is one of the first things built on the web for Flutter. To improve performance on the web, improvements are made, such as CanvasKit reductions, redacted font sizes, and deferred loading. Furthermore, Tim Sneath showcased how a master channel and custom CanvasKit can reduce load times by up to 40%.
WebAssembly support for compiling Flutter to the web makes element embedding possible. By taking Dart and Flutter code and compiling it into a div, it can be used as a web component where the Flutter state can be pushed to the Javascript side and vice versa, with both states affecting each other. CSS effects such as shadows, resizing, and device modes are also achievable with live changes to the Flutter section of the web app being made available. Pixel shaders allow low-level functions to be run on GPU for high-end effects that can now be used on the web, giving more power to Flutter for creating attractive designs.
Leigha Jarett's mobile section presentation included several new features, such as improved text input, support for foldable devices, support for variable refresh rate, simplified the release process, enhanced developer tooling, and improving performance. The [Flutter News Toolkit](https://flutter.dev/news) is now available to create high-quality news apps quickly and is set to save 80% of developer time. [Wonderous](https://flutter.gskinner.com/wonderous/), a Flutter reference app, has also been updated with an adaptive design for all screen sizes. It's now possible to call different mobile APIs directly from Dart, such as HealthConnectClient from Android and CMPedometor from iOS, thanks to the new FFigen & Jnigen tool that can create and handle 'bindings' in Flutter and can auto-generate code that calls different APIs from different platforms.
Impeller is the next breakthrough in graphics performance and offers an optimal solution for eliminating shader compilation jank. Impeller increases the smoothness and performance of the graphic engine significantly when compared to Skia, and its new capabilities enable other use cases, such as 3D and animations. Leigha showcased this capability by painting a 3D dash in Flutter using Blender, which can now be changed, and these changes can be seen in real-time through hot reload. Additionally, animations can be added and shown using hot reload. Impeller efficiently handled over 343 animated Dashes with over 10.000 moving animated joints.

# Flutter Revolution
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60216c6bcdeba0edd17bb8b0_baseflow_loves_flutter2_v6.jpg)
## As Flutter is in a winning position as a development platform and we are gearing up our investment in Flutter technology, here is a reflection on what we’ve seen happening.
As [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is in a winning position as a development platform and we are gearing up our investment in Flutter technology, I wanted to reflect a bit on what we’ve seen happening.
I’ve been in a management role for the last few years, so I didn't run into the Flutter platform the usual way. Of course, I’ve heard the talks from developers at the coffee machine, but to me that sounded like the usual Monday morning “he, there’s a new platform/package that is sooo much better than everything we had last week”. 
No, it’s my Operating System Fetish (yes, it’s a very complicated condition) that brought my attention to Flutter. This interest in Operating Systems makes me browse the Linux kernel mailing list on a regular basis. Nothing more relaxing then some fine engineers debating over very complicated low-level stuff :-)
Anyways, over the last few years Google has had a ‘secret’ OS project called [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev). Next to Linux I frequently browse it’s repositories as well (I know, super weird) and it is a very exciting project. Mainly because it rather fundamentally differs from everything else that exists at this time (which in itself is food for another blog, because it is really cool!).
At some point, I was wondering how end-user applications could be written for this new OS and after some investigation, I found out that one of the solutions for this is … Flutter!
Now I **was** interested enough and wanted to learn more about it. At that point in time, we started Baseflow and for the first big mobile projects we did, we picked Flutter. Scary, because at that time it was beta and we all know what ‘beta’ means inside Google ;-) 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60216c6bcdeba0edd17bb8b0_baseflow_loves_flutter2_v6.jpg)
**Fast forward to today** where basically Flutter is our default choice for mobile projects these days. Our developers (and designers!) love it, development time has shortened and the results are beautiful, high performing apps!
But besides the great technology itself is something else that is equally as impressive: the way the Flutter product is being handled from a product management perspective. **Creating great technology is one thing, but managing a product when it scales and is being used by a large crowd of critical developers is another.** I’ve seen multiple “no, we’re not gonna do that” answers to feature requests and nothing is being rushed. The recent ‘nullable’ feature is a nice example of that: it is being worked on for more than a year but the end result is worth it. 
It is this (rare) combination of technical excitement and meticulous attention to detail that makes us very enthusiastic about Flutter and we have full confidence in its bright future. That’s also being reflected in the effort we put in Open Source Flutter plugins (we are the creators of some of Flutters most popular plugins) and we’re going to increase that effort over the next year. 
And yes, it would be awesome if someone contacts us for building a Flutter app specifically for Fuchsia ;-)

# Flutter Revolution
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/62ff65e9c7c5853af050fa12_60216c6bcdeba0edd17bb8b0_baseflow_loves_flutter2_v6.jpeg)
## As Flutter is in a winning position as a development platform and we are gearing up our investment in Flutter technology, we wanted to reflect a bit on what we’ve seen happening.
As [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) is in a winning position as a development platform and we are gearing up our investment in Flutter technology, I wanted to reflect a bit on what we’ve seen happening.
I’ve been in a management role for the last few years, so I didn't run into the Flutter platform the usual way. Of course, I’ve heard the talks from developers at the coffee machine, but to me that sounded like the usual Monday morning “he, there’s a new platform/package that is sooo much better than everything we had last week”. 
No, it’s my Operating System Fetish (yes, it’s a very complicated condition) that brought my attention to Flutter. This interest in Operating Systems makes me browse the Linux kernel mailing list on a regular basis. Nothing more relaxing then some fine engineers debating over very complicated low-level stuff :-)
Anyways, over the last few years Google has had a ‘secret’ OS project called [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev). Next to Linux I frequently browse it’s repositories as well (I know, super weird) and it is a very exciting project. Mainly because it rather fundamentally differs from everything else that exists at this time (which in itself is food for another blog, because it is really cool!).
At some point, I was wondering how end-user applications could be written for this new OS and after some investigation, I found out that one of the solutions for this is … Flutter! Now I **was** interested enough and wanted to learn more about it. At that point in time, we started Baseflow and for the first big mobile projects we did, we picked Flutter. Scary, because at that time it was beta and we all know what ‘beta’ means inside Google ;-) 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60216c6bcdeba0edd17bb8b0_baseflow_loves_flutter2_v6.jpg)
**Fast forward to today** where basically Flutter is our default choice for mobile projects these days. Our developers (and designers!) love it, development time has shortened and the results are beautiful, high performing apps!
But besides the great technology itself is something else that is equally as impressive: the way the Flutter product is being handled from a product management perspective. **Creating great technology is one thing, but managing a product when it scales and is being used by a large crowd of critical developers is another.** I’ve seen multiple “no, we’re not gonna do that” answers to feature requests and nothing is being rushed. The recent ‘nullable’ feature is a nice example of that: it is being worked on for more than a year but the end result is worth it. 
It is this (rare) combination of technical excitement and meticulous attention to detail that makes us very enthusiastic about Flutter and we have full confidence in its bright future. That’s also being reflected in the effort we put in Open Source Flutter plugins (we are the creators of some of Flutters most popular plugins) and we’re going to increase that effort over the next year. 
And yes, it would be awesome if someone contacts us for building a Flutter app specifically for Fuchsia ;-)

# Flutter VS. .NET MAUI. What is the better choice for 2023?
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6374ac951070415ec7c3a457_IMGP5882%20\(2\).webp)
## There is an overlap between functionalities between Flutter and .NET MAUI. In this article we discuss which framework is the better choice for 2023.
### .NET MAUI vs Flutter: Understanding the Architecture and Differences
.NET MAUI and Flutter are two popular frameworks for developing cross-platform applications. But what exactly is .NET MAUI, and how does it compare to Flutter? In this comprehensive blog post, we will delve into the MAUI VS. Flutter debate to understand their differences, strengths, and weaknesses.
### What is .NET MAUI?
.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft, allowing developers to create native applications for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows using a single codebase. It is an evolution of Xamarin.Forms, built on top of the .NET ecosystem, and provides a modern, efficient, and highly productive way to build applications with .NET.
### **What is Flutter, and what are its benefits over other frameworks such as .NET MAUI**
Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It is based on the Dart programming language and provides a reactive development approach, offering a rich set of widgets, animations, and other UI components that allow developers to create visually appealing applications. 
Flutter's architecture is composed of three main layers:
a. Framework Layer: This layer includes the Dart-based UI toolkit that provides a rich set of widgets, animations, and gesture recognition components.
b. Engine Layer: The Engine Layer is written in C++ and is responsible for rendering graphics, text, and handling other low-level operations. It communicates with the Framework Layer through the Flutter Embedder API.
c. Embedder Layer: The Embedder Layer is platform-specific and provides an entry point for the application. It is responsible for initializing the engine, managing the application window, handling input events, and other platform-specific tasks.
One of the benefits of Flutter over other platforms, such as .NET MAUI, is that it offers a more responsive and faster user interface. 
Additionally, Flutter supports Material Design for Android and Cupertino for iOS, allowing developers to create apps with native look and feel for each platform. However, .NET MAUI also supports out of the box material design for Android and Cupertino for iOS. Another benefit of Flutter is its hot reload feature, which lets developers quickly test changes in their code without recompiling the entire app. Both Flutter and .NET MAUI heavily support this feature, however it is up to your personal preference to decide which one you prefer.
Overall, Flutter provides an efficient way for developers to create cross-platform applications.
### .NET MAUI vs Flutter: Comparing the Differences
#### Language and Ecosystem 
.NET MAUI is built on the .NET ecosystem, using C# as the primary programming language. This allows developers to leverage the extensive .NET libraries and tooling available. Flutter, on the other hand, uses the Dart programming language, which may require developers to learn a new language if they are not already familiar with it.
#### UI Components
.NET MAUI uses native UI components to render its user interface, while Flutter uses its custom rendering engine to draw UI components. This means that .NET MAUI applications may have a more consistent native look and feel, while Flutter applications may have a more unique appearance that can be easily customized.
#### Performance
Since .NET MAUI utilizes native UI components, it can deliver better performance on some platforms. Flutter, however, uses its rendering engine, which may lead to slightly lower performance in certain cases. However, both frameworks offer excellent performance overall, and the difference may not be noticeable in most applications.
#### Community and Support
Both .NET MAUI and Flutter have strong communities and extensive documentation. Microsoft backs .NET MAUI, which ensures continued support and development. Similarly, Google supports Flutter, ensuring a robust ecosystem and a growing developer community.
### **Case studies of successful Flutter projects**
Many (successful) mobile applications use Flutter. We will take a look at three successful case studies of Flutter projects.
The first project is a car-sharing service called [Amigo](https://www.baseflow.com/cases/louwman-amigo). Amigo is a streamlined user-friendly app wherein you can share your Amigo lease car with your amigo's. Everything is controlled through the app, and the costs are automatically divided. The app was developed using Flutter and Dart and ran on iOS and Android devices. Amigo is praised for its clean design, smooth user experience, and fast performance.

The second project is a facility management tool called [OneGo](https://www.baseflow.com/cases/asito). OneGo is a platform that can link facility tasks to the right person in the chain. The application is suitable for collaboration between different facility partners so that everyone can benefit from innovative and efficient working. Within the sleek UI of the application, end-users can report location-based issues, schedule and trigger tasks, assigns tasks, and fully trace every step within the process. OneGo is used by many businesses, such as Schiphol and Droomparken, and is praised for its fast performance and user-friendliness.

The third project is a car-sharing platform called [WeGo](https://www.baseflow.com/cases/wego). WeGo is focused on increasing the occupancy rate of vehicles and contributing to society by reducing worldwide car emissions. A seamless booking and driving experience with a dedicated app for end-users that makes it possible for businesses to get the most out of their mobility fleets.

These three case studies demonstrate the potential of Flutter for developing high-quality cross-platform apps. If you are considering creating a mobile app, consider using Flutter.
### Flutter VS. maui
In short, when deciding on a cross-platform toolkit, developers face many choices. Two of the most popular options are Flutter and .NET MAUI. While both tools provide a way to build native apps for multiple platforms from a single codebase, they have some key differences.
One key advantage of Flutter is its speed. It uses Dart, a fast, efficient language that allows for hot reloading, meaning you can make changes to your code and see the results almost instantly. .NET MAUI is also fast. Still, it can be more challenging to learn for beginners.
In addition, Flutter offers greater flexibility when it comes to design. Developers can use any widgets they want and are not limited to a specific set of tools or components. This gives them the freedom to create truly unique applications. With over 100+ Widgets, you can create beautiful, complex apps without sacrificing speed or performance. .NET MAUI also has a widget library, but it isn't as comprehensive.
Finally, Flutter apps tend to be smaller and faster than those built with .NET MAUI. This is partly due to the small size of the compiled code. Overall, Flutter provides a more efficient and flexible solution for cross-platform app development.
### **How to get started with Flutter development**
If you're interested in developing cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter, there are a few things you need to get started. First, you'll need to install the Flutter SDK. This can be done using the instructions on the Flutter website. Once the SDK is installed, you'll also need an IDE or text editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code, which has excellent support for Flutter development. Finally, you'll need to set up an emulator or simulator to test your apps on a device. I suggest using the Android Emulator, which can be installed through the Android Studio IDE. With these tools in place, you're ready to start developing with Flutter!
### **Where to find more information about Flutter development**
When it comes to Flutter development, there's no shortage of resources available. The internet is littered with articles, tutorials, and templates, all of which can be useful in one way or another. However, sifting through all of this information can be a daunting task. To make things easier, here are a few of the best places to look for Flutter development resources:
-The official Flutter website: This is the best place to start. The website contains everything you need to begin with Flutter, including step-by-step guides, API documentation, and sample code.
-The FlutterDev subreddit is an excellent place to ask questions, find answers, and stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments in the world of Flutter.
-Medium: There are several great articles about Flutter development on Medium. You can find everything from tips and tricks to in-depth tutorials.
-YouTube: There's a wealth of information available on YouTube, including videos from Google Developers and other experts in the field.
With so many resources at your disposal, there's no excuse not to start with Flutter development today.

# Flutter VS. React Native: Which framework should you use in 2023?
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6385d133aa1d027033021913_IMGP5877_60.webp)
## Flutter and React Native are two popular frameworks for mobile app development. Both allow developers to create cross-platform apps that can run on iOS and Android devices. However, there are some critical differences between the two frameworks.
### **What are Flutter and React Native, and what are their key differences?**
Flutter is a newer framework that is gaining popularity among developers. It uses the Dart programming language and provides a more responsive user interface than React Native. In addition, Flutter apps can be compiled into native code, making them faster and more reliable. One of the most significant advantages of Flutter is its fast development cycle. Thanks to its hot reload feature, changes can be made and seen in real time without recompiling the code. This means that developers can iterate quickly and efficiently during app development. Additionally, Flutter’s widget library provides a wide range of UI elements that can be customized to match the branding of any app.
However, one downside of Flutter is that not as many companies have yet adopted it as React Native, there is a smaller pool of available resources and documentation. Another downside is that Flutter is relatively new, which means there is a smaller pool of talent to draw from when hiring developers.
React Native is a more established framework that has been around since 2015. React Native is a framework created by Facebook that allows developers to build native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript. React Native has been around for longer than Flutter, which means there is more support and guidance available from the community. In addition, React Native apps tend to be more stable than those built with Flutter. Moreover, because React Native uses JavaScript, it will be familiar to any developer with a web development background. React Native has just as Flutter has, a hot reload functionality. 
However, one downside of React Native is that it can be more difficult to debug than other frameworks. Additionally, some components of React Native apps may not work on all devices, so developers need to be aware of potential compatibility issues; React Native is not as easy to have it run perfectly on Mac and Web compared to Flutter.
Both Flutter and React Native are excellent choices for mobile app development. However, developers should choose the framework that best fits their needs and the needs of their project. Both Flutter and React Native both have cross-platform functionalities and a useful hot reload functionality, however Flutter still bolsters a shorter development cycle. 
### **The popularity of Flutter and React Native**
The popularity of Flutter and React Native has grown exponentially in recent years as more and more businesses turn to cross-platform mobile app development to save time and money. While there are many reasons for this popularity, two stand out above the rest: the ability to develop high-quality apps quickly and the many available libraries and frameworks. 
With Flutter, developers can create beautiful, fast-performing apps with a single codebase that can be deployed on both iOS and Android devices. 
Similarly, React Native provides a platform for developing rich mobile apps using JavaScript while still allowing access to native platform features. As a result, it’s no surprise that these two platforms have become the go-to choice for businesses looking to develop cross-platform mobile apps.
### **Which framework will be more popular in 2023**
Both Flutter and React Native offer a wide range of features and benefits, making them attractive options for businesses of all sizes. However, Flutter is expected to be more prevalent in 2023. One reason for this is that Flutter offers better performance than React Native. Additionally, Flutter apps are easier to develop since they require less code than React Native apps. As a result, Flutter is expected to be the preferred choice for businesses that want to create high-quality mobile apps quickly and efficiently.
### **Conclusion**
Flutter and React Native are two of the most popular frameworks for mobile app development. Both have their benefits and drawbacks, but they're both relatively easy to learn and use. 
Flutter is a cross-platform framework that can be used to develop apps for both iOS and Android. It's known for being fast and responsive, and for having a wide range of built-in features. 
React Native, on the other hand, is a framework that allows you to develop native apps for both iOS and Android using the React framework. It's known for being relatively easy to learn and use. 
So, which one should you choose? If you're just starting, either one would be a good choice. However, if you're looking for something easier to learn and results in better-looking apps, you should consider using Flutter over React Native.

# Functional programming for modern languages
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e82fa44871814875cfa60_carbon\(6\).png)
## This blog post will cover how you can leverage functional programming in C# using a few simple classes and extension methods, with insights applicable to other modern languages that support lambda expressions or closures.
Having spent over 15 years writing C# code focused on Object Oriented Programming, I recently ventured into the Rust programming language, known for its functional programming capabilities. As I started to appreciate Rust’s features, like Options, Results, and Map functions, I wondered how to integrate functional programming principles into my C# development. 
All code for this blogpost can be found [in this Github repository](https://github.com/tluijken/functional-csharp-examples)
### Characteristics of Functional programming
Before we dive into code, I should first clarify a bit on the characteristics of functional programming.
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, the use of pure functions, and the avoidance of side effects. Its core characteristics include treating functions as first-class citizens, which allows them to be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in data structures. Functional programming also promotes the use of higher-order functions that take other functions as input or return them as output. Recursion is often favored over looping constructs, and the use of immutable data structures ensures that data remains unmodified throughout the program’s execution. This paradigm ultimately leads to more predictable, concise, and maintainable code, making it increasingly popular among developers for its ability to manage complexity and promote robust software design.
  * **Immutability** : Data remains unmodified throughout the program’s execution, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.
  * **Pure functions** : Functions depend solely on their input and produce consistent output without causing side effects.
  * **First-class functions** : Functions can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in data structures.
  * **Higher-order functions** : Functions that accept other functions as input or return them as output, enabling powerful composition and abstraction techniques.
  * **Recursion** : Repeated function calls to solve problems, often used as an alternative to looping constructs.
  * **Declarative programming** : Code focuses on expressing what should be done, rather than detailing step-by-step procedures.
  * **Lazy evaluation** : Computation is deferred until absolutely necessary, improving performance and avoiding unnecessary work.
  * **Pattern matching** : A flexible way to destructure data and match specific patterns, allowing for concise and readable code.
  * **Type inference** : Automatic determination of data types by the compiler, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
  * **Referential transparency** : Functions with the same input always produce the same output, making code easier to reason about and test.


### Problems with imperative programming
Let’s start with a quick example: converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5b1748f56a249fe1b2ba_carbon.png)
It’s worth noting that a, b, and c have a longer lifespan than necessary and could be unintentionally used elsewhere in the code. This could result in unexpected outcomes, so it’s important to be cautious when reusing variables outside of their intended scope.
While it may seem obvious, I’ve seen this mistake happen more than once in larger code implementations. To prevent unexpected outcomes, it’s best to eliminate intermediate values as soon as they are no longer needed. This helps to avoid unintentional reuse of variables outside of their intended scope.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5b243c5d737f9796ffe2_carbon%20\(1\).png)
### Scoping and mutability
Scoping and mutability are important concepts to keep in mind when working with variables in a program. As for the Map function, it takes a value and a conversion function, which enables the transformation of values in a clear and concise way. To illustrate, consider the following example:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5b32881609b6c6524cae_carbon%20\(2\).png)
By utilizing this method, I can perform the same steps as before while ensuring that intermediate values are scoped appropriately. Since the converted value is returned, we can immediately chain a new Map function to it and continue processing without having to worry about reusing variables unintentionally.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5b42eb2fbe7958da6e42_carbon%20\(3\).png)
### Making it declaritive
Although the previous function ensures that intermediate values are short-lived and immutable, it can still be challenging to read and understand. However, by making it more declarative, we can shift our focus to what we want to accomplish rather than how to do it. One approach to achieving this is by utilizing a technique called [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying).
Currying transforms a multi-argument function into a series of single-argument functions that return another function, until all necessary arguments are provided.
To illustrate, consider the following example of a curried function:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5b528434a939186c77ff_carbon%20\(4\).png)
Which does the exact same thing as this fully written example.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e85fef1121b4cc5ec2805_carbon\(11\).png)
The Multiply function takes a parameter (the multiplier) and returns a new function that multiplies a given value by the specified multiplier. When calling a curried function, you can do so by providing the arguments one at a time, like this:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5b890c6754f5a1c8e931_carbon%20\(6\).png)
Although it may seem unconventional at first, what we’re doing here is actually an example of partial application. With partial application, you can supply some of the arguments ahead of time and reuse that partial application as many times as needed. This can be a powerful technique depending on the use case you’re working on, so take a moment to let it sink in.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5b9c8b508ed9fcdebaa6_carbon%20\(7\).png)
Now, let’s consider how we could use these curried functions with our Map function to apply the necessary transformations:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5bad5aa71704565d4d1e_carbon%20\(8\).png)
To simplify the process even further, we can utilize the shorthand notation that C# provides to apply the curried functions:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5bbe8e83ff208cb2d668_carbon%20\(9\).png)
By implementing a declarative approach that utilizes immutable values, we now have a clear and concise conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit that is easy to read and far less prone to errors.
> But that seems like a lot of work, for such a simple task Thomas.
While it may seem like a lot of work for such a simple task, it’s important to keep in mind that the functions we created can be packaged and reused across multiple projects. This makes the investment of time and effort in creating them well worth it in the long run, as it can lead to greater efficiency and consistency in your codebase.
### Functional validation
Now, let’s consider a larger example: validating a Dutch phone number. While we won’t be using regular expressions in this example, we’ll provide an imperative implementation to illustrate the concept.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5c0e00a53b8868926875_carbon%20\(10\).png)
To validate a phone number, there are several steps involved. If any of these steps fail, it’s important to return as early as possible to save CPU cycles. However, the imperative approach used to accomplish this focuses primarily on how to validate the phone number, rather than what we actually want to achieve. This can result in a lot of noise, with if checks and return statements that make the code difficult to read.
To address this issue, we can utilize a [higher-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) function and pass in a set of validation functions to aggregate over. This will allow us to focus more on the what of the problem, rather than the how.
First, we’ll need to split up the various validations into named functions.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5bfb8b508e1e13debd4b_carbon%20\(11\).png)
This accomplishes the same result as the previous imperative approach, but with the validations split up into named functions.
Now, we can further improve this by using a higher-order function to aggregate over the validation functions. We can create a Validate extension method that takes in all of the validation functions as arguments.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5c32989cf6384c775c17_carbon%20\(12\).png)
The All method used on the predicates is a useful feature because it returns false as soon as one of the predicates fails to return true, which is equivalent to the early return false statements used in the imperative implementation. By using the Validate method on the phone number itself, we can easily validate the number using a declarative approach with more readable code that focuses on what we want rather than how we want to validate it.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5c4e8816096ccf525f80_carbon%20\(13\).png)
Adding additional validations becomes much easier as we can simply add them to the list of validations without worrying about the control flow of an imperative implementation.
Anonymous functions can also be used in place of named functions for more concise code. Here’s an example using anonymous functions to validate a username.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5c5d3267b788754a6af9_carbon%20\(14\).png)
### Monads
In many cases, we need to convert data in a sequence of steps into a different form. Consider this Person class, for example
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e876948f7e72836c14a85_carbon\(12\).png)
If we have a person record and we want to get the first name of the spouse, we can access it like this:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e85a23c78bc7ab9c953d9_carbon\(10\).png)
However, depending on the language version and the nullable settings for your project, either of these values can be null, despite what the compiler may suggest, and the operation would fail at runtime. To handle this, we would need to add null checks.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5c9f8b508e47acdecd20_carbon%20\(17\).png)
This approach adds a lot of clutter to our code and shifts the focus away from what we’re trying to accomplish. To avoid this, we can use a design pattern in which the pipeline implementation is abstracted by wrapping a value in a type. This pattern is called a [Monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_\(functional_programming\)), which you can learn more about in the functional programming paradigm. Within functional programming, you’ll find types such as Result or Option (also called Maybe) that wrap the values for each result in a pipeline.
Here’s what our Option type looks like:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5cf461adbb366999d168_carbon%20\(18\).png)
For our Option type, I will define 2 subtypes: Some and None:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5d0f26c6776b45d9fe9d_carbon%20\(19\).png)
A value can be implicitly converted to Some if the value is not null, and can be implicitly converted to None if the value is null.
Now, let’s extend our mapping function a bit:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5dbadf1dd02684cbfca6_carbon%20\(20\).png)
In this case, we first check if the value we got is actually a value or if it’s None. If we got a None value, we’ll simply return another None.
If we got a Some value, we can now safely attempt to map the value by using the provided factory method. If the mapping fails, we’ll return None. Otherwise, we’ll return a new Some value wrapping the mapped result.
By abstracting this logic away into the Map method, we can now chain our calls without worrying about control flow or null checks. This allows us to focus on the data transformations we want to achieve, rather than the boilerplate code for handling null values.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5dd2df1dd01197cbff00_carbon%20\(21\).png)
If the person is None, or the spouse is None, or the firstname of the spouse is None, we will just return None. If all values are set, the firstname of the spouse will be returned.
We can continue chaining these operations to process the data as needed.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5de3547b8c00c4cf8b3b_carbon%20\(22\).png)
The code in the previous paragraph illustrates a situation where we get the spouse of the spouse of the spouse, and so on, until we eventually encounter a null value somewhere in the chain. This approach is also known as “[Railway oriented programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/)”, which emphasizes handling success and failure paths in a linear manner.
### Performing intermediate logic
At times, you may want to include additional logic in the pipelines mentioned earlier. For instance, you may want to log an intermediate value before proceeding with further operations on the same result.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5e157bf2fe05f9d88102_carbon%20\(23\).png)
Functional programming can be used to accomplish this goal by creating a function known as Tee.
> The term ‘Tee’ is named after the Unix command ‘tee’, which is named after the T-shaped pipe fitting.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e847679b35fe343a77a78_carbon\(7\).png)
We can now achieve the same, but calling the Tee function where we want:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e5e418d1560463f11be39_carbon%20\(25\).png)
As you can see, the logic for printing whether the spouse has a value is now grouped within the same scope, and not divided over multiple lines. After we’re done logging the spouse value, we can continue mapping as before. This allows us to perform additional operations on the same result without breaking the pipeline, making our code more readable and maintainable.
### Mutability
I really like the fact that the Rust programming language is designed to be immutable by default, unless specified otherwise, which can be challenging for some developers at first. However, it is a good practice to consider whether a value should be mutable or not, as many issues with state and concurrency can lead to various bugs. By defaulting to immutability, we force ourselves to think about these issues more carefully.
In C#, the introduction of records and the with operator has made it much easier to have immutable types and values. In our Person record, the fields are immutable, so they can only be set once on an instance.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e857f42ed4e3f62ee55d2_carbon\(9\).png)
Our compiler will not allow the code snippet above to compile, as the properties on the Person record can only be set when the instance is instantiated. Therefore, what we actually need is an updated version of that instance. The with operator allows us to create a copy of the original record, initializing the members with the same values as the original, or a different value if specified within the with operator. Since the fields on our Person record are immutable, this will create a new instance of the Person record with the updated fields.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/643e84f0f1121bbfffec12b4_carbon\(8\).png)
If another thread comes along and alters the _person private field somewhere within our sequence, our test would still succeed, as we’re not referring to a mutable instance. This is a prime example of pure functions, where we have no side effects.

# How to build a mobile app
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/62ff65eac32e912444af3cbe_60214f95ba84fe01f3aea3b2_Blog%2520header-%2520build%2520an%2520app.jpeg)
## A complete guide to building an app. Here are the most straightforward and essential steps to ensure your app will be created in the best way possible to achieve your goals.
### A complete guide to building an app
You have decided to make an app. Congratulations! You have a killer idea for a new app to help your business or the next idea that is going to be the no 1# app in all of the stores.
Here are the most straightforward and essential steps to ensure your app will be created in the best way possible to achieve your goals. 
#### 1. Define the app
What is the primary function of your app? In two sentences or less, describe what it is your app will do. Do you want to connect people? Solve a problem for your business? Provide an outlet for entertainment? These are broad questions with many answers, but only you can answer them! It's also a good idea to check and see if someone else also has had your great idea and research into existing or similar apps. If your idea already exists, don't let it stop you. Just make sure you make it better than what is already out there.
#### 2. Who will be the end-user of your app? 
Deciding or your target audience will inform all of your next decisions. For example, if you are building an app as a tool for employees to use, the requirements won't be the same for an app designed for customers. Your employees will want a device that is useful to them and streamlines processes, and the customers will want their own specific needs fulfilled. Understand what your audience needs. What you know upfront now will help with your design, feature implementation, and marketing plans.
#### 3. Define and set a budget 
It is essential to set aside a realistic budget for your app. A custom-built app is going to cost money. It is an investment. If you are building an app for your business, the money you spend here should see a significant improvement in other areas of your business. It could help generate revenue, save time and resources, or completely replace outdated methods of working. If you don't have a big budget, there are other pre-built apps that you can consider; however, your great idea is likely going to need a custom build.

#### 4. Set a project timeline
Budgets and timelines always go hand in hand. Use your app definition to determine what your app needs to be able to do and by when. What needs to happen first and what can wait until a later release.
#### 5. Host a discovery and definition session with Baseflow 
You may not even realize the potential your idea has. We can help you connect your ideas with available technologies and turn your app into a fantastic success story. We can review your approach, budget, and timeline and set your expectations about what is possible. We can work together on different scenarios to make your idea come to life. 
#### 6. Choose an app advocate
Communication is everything when building an app. You need an advocate within your business to help realize the implementation of the app. Your advocate or project manager can outline and set clear expectations and responsibilities for the project within your business. We will help you every step of the way. It is also essential to identify who the final decision-makers are and the approval process that is in place.
#### 7. The design 
Do you know how you want the app to look and feel? The design of the app is a critical part of the app's success. Is it easy to navigate, how does the content show, what happens after every action. All actions have to have a nice flow. We can help you put your design together and review and give feedback on your designs for the optimal user experience.

#### 8. What sort of features do you want it to include?
Building and planning your app is a journey. If you don't know precisely what you want, that's fine. You can figure it out along the way. However, you do need a clear idea upfront about what the app needs to do. Perhaps something changes within your business, and you need a new set of features. Sort your elements into the following categories. You can plot these desires out across your project timeline.
- Must have- Nice to have- Needed in a later release 
#### 9. What platform do you want to use? 
Android, iOS or Cross-Platform
Depending on your end-users, the technology you have in place, and your budget and timeline, we can help you make the best decision about which platform to use. 
#### 10. Are you ready to work in an Agile method? 
Are you ready to work in an Agile method? 
When you work with Baseflow, it is a partnership. We work together for the duration of the project and beyond. Working Agile means you are able and willing to work with our teams and incrementally complete tasks and the project. We begin the project with a 'Sprint Zero.' Sprint Zero seeks to offer an opportunity for clarity, to plan a framework for success and ensure a working Sprint environment. The scenario is not that you ask us to build an app for you, and three months later, we deliver that app. You will never get the desired app if you work in this way. Your internal app advocate works with the Baseflow team to ensure on a weekly basis your project is on track. Are you willing to let go of how you have run projects before and work with a new methodology? We're ready to help talk you through it. ‍

‍
#### 11. Security
App security isn't a feature or a benefit; it is a necessity. It is one of the most critical aspects of your app. Rule #1 for security is always to not reinvent the wheel, there are plenty of standards in place. For our backend communication, we use JWT tokens in an OAuth-like flow. We ensure that your app is built with the latest security requirements to keep your data safe.
#### 12. Testing and Quality Assurance 
Don't give your users an excuse to use your competitors' app. Perform regular testing and quality assurance to stay ahead of the competition. 
We can help you set up a plan. We have a dedicated QA team that has experience testing mobile apps on a variety of different platforms. We can do automated, manual testing, or both! 
#### 13. Deployment & Maintenance
Once your app is launched in the store or within your business, it is an exciting and momentous occasion to celebrate, but note, it is not the end of the project. The app will require updates and maintenance. It is essential to consider the level of support and maintenance that you will need and ensure that your developers can provide this. Do you have a plan for releasing frequent updates to the App Store and Google Play? What happens if your entire team upgrades its technology? Things change, and it's best to be prepared for that.
#### 14. Improve Your App With User Feedback
Real user feedback is vital for making improvements to an app. Use a mix of app analytics to gather quantitative data and ask users directly with surveys or interviews to get qualitative data. Review your comments and ratings in the app store. Check-in with your employees using the app. You don't have to solve everything or cater to every request, but it is a useful measuring tool to review your expectations of the app with how people are interacting with it in the real world. 
#### What's Next?
If you made it all the way here, congratulations! That was a lot of information, and I wouldn't be surprised if you are feeling a little overwhelmed. I recommend you figure out where you are in this app making process, and then get in contact with Baseflow.

# How to create an effective teamwork environment
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/62ff65e9769a72f638c8a22a_60214de6f38ee713482d728a_team-in-mud-blog.jpeg)
## Developing a capable team in your organization can seem like a simple and straightforward task; however, it can be challenging to execute and put into practice. Here are some tips.
### Effective teamwork is an essential aspect of any organization's success.
And it is something that every organization strives for. Whether it's a band, a baseball team, or a Fortune 500 company, we have all heard success stories of teams who revolutionized the world. 
> The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime.– Babe Ruth 
It is an essential leadership competency for any size organization to have the ability to build and lead high-performing teams. Unless you are running a one-person show, effective teamwork in the workplace accomplishes much more than any one individual can. Developing a capable team in your organization can seem like a simple and straightforward task; however, it can be challenging to execute and put into practice.

‍
### What does 'team' even mean?
So what is a team? Katzenbach and Smith (1993) came up with a definition: "A team is a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they are mutually accountable." *2
For the team to perform better, there are some key factors they need to thrive. A model that suggests that many factors influence a team's productivity and cohesiveness. *3 *4. It will help you understand how teams perform and how to maximize their performance. This I-M-O-I model works with an input, mediators/process and output see figure 1 below. 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6021670711760a1dcd3345d9_The-Input-Mediator-Outcome-Input-IMOI-Team-Effectiveness-Framework.png)
### Input
The model has an input *3 *4. The input exists of culture, team members, and their skills and knowledge, and attitude and about the task the team gets. What is crucial for a company when you want a great team is a culture. Culture is mainly influenced by the founder, managers, and other management employees of the organization because of their role in decision-making and strategic direction. Be clear about what you want. Also, be continuous about who sits on leadership positions and who decides what. This can make or break a team. Team members' skills, attitude, and knowledge is essential. Who are the team members, what knowledge, competences, qualities, and attitudes do individual team members have? What does the team consist of? There has to be a degree of common beliefs, expectations, and perceptions of knowledge and skills of members. Team members are viewed as unique people with invaluable experiences, points of view, knowledge, and opinions to contribute. After all, the purpose of forming a team is to take advantage of the differences.
### Mediators
In the middle of the framework there is the process or mediators *3 *4. After the input the process starts. This exist of leadership, goals, communication, consensus, strategy, trust and conflict
### Leadership
When leading, always work harder than you preach. Your employees look up to you, and you are their leader, so behave like one. Lead by example, listen to their problems, give them the solutions, show them you care, that you are a member of the team. Any project manager leading a project and a team to success should be a role model, thus showing an example to team members. At the same time, in an efficient team, a manager is not only a leader; he or she is also a member like everyone else who is not afraid to do minor tasks. Realizing that a manager performs the same scope of work, individual team members will work harder, which certainly will improve efficiency.
### Goals
Set clear and specific goals. The team needs to know and understand what they are working towards. The leader must be clear on setting such goals. For ultimate performance, you need universal buy-in from each team member. A commitment to agreeing on the mission. This sense of purpose and clarity sets your team up in a space for success.
### Communication
The communication is open, honest, and respectful. There is just enough communication, not too little, and not too much. If not enough is shared, parts of the mission will fall to pieces. If there is over communication (rare as it is), your team will feel overwhelmed and disengage with the set task. People should be able to express their thoughts, opinions, and potential solutions to problems freely. When team members feel that they are being heard and listened to by team members who are attempting to understand, opportunities to ask questions, formally or informally need to be encouraged. There needs to be space for team members to listen to each other, hear each other, and then form their responses. If this level of clear communication is instilled in the team, all challenges can be overcome.

### Consensus
Although it takes much longer to reach this, this method ultimately offers better decisions and higher productivity as it ensures the involvement of every employee at all stages of work. *5
### Strategy
Planning and strategy the approach of the team on the goals tasks. 
### Trust is crucial
When trust is present, people step forward and do their best work together, efficiently. They align around a common purpose, take risks, think out of the box, have each other's backs, and communicate openly and honestly. If a team cannot trust each other, the flow of information is interrupted. The skills of your highly talented team get too lost to the team member's agenda or insecurities, rather than achieving the teams' collective goal. *6
### Conflict is ok
Some amount of conflict is inevitable on the team with a variety of experts. Conflict is necessary and helpful to problem-solving, as long as it is given a space to be shared, and a resolution can be reached. Clashing personalities or opposing viewpoints can bring new thoughts and discussions on aspects of a project that had not been imagined before. The type of conflict that is not good for a team is the unspoken resentment that can erupt in an outburst, or even more deadly, quiet mutiny or deviation from agreed-upon roles, tasks, and goals. It is important that the team can openly discuss differing views without it, resulting in a shouting match or hurt feelings.
### Output - Input
Then there is also an output in this framework. The outcome is more productive teams, better or more tasks - product outcome, more content, cohesion, and learning outcomes like skills and knowledge*3 *4.This circle of input, the mediators and output, as described, will repeat itself daily, weekly, and monthly; it is not bound to a specific time or project. It is an ongoing organic process that needs to be facilitated and guided. As this process unfolds, however, the team members will begin to trust and support one another and share their skill sets and effort to more effectively complete your organization's goals. Every day if you do it right, the team will be more effective in what they do and how to do it. They will get to know each other and build a sustainable and effective work environment. In the process, they will learn new skills, attitude, and gain more knowledge. Also, there will be more cohesion in the group. So the group feels more like one. Cohesion improves teamwork between members, but that performance quality influences cohesion more than cohesion affects performance. The working group may not be successful because of coherence, but instead, it can be cohesive because it performs well. *4

# Why doing whatever you like is more difficult than you think
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/62ff65ea12d11d72a9b50de5_61dc091d8704722523c38248_10percenttime5.jpeg)
## At Baseflow you can use 10% of your time to do whatever you like. Sounds easy enough, but is it really?
The contract of a Baseflow employee states: “You get 10% of your working time to do whatever you want. Work on Open Source projects, discover new technologies, be creative or even play a game of foosball.” Sounds easy enough, but is it really?
Baseflow’s founders started this company with a People First vision. Meaning that if employees enjoy their work, are trusted as experts, and get lots of freedom, it results in quality work and happy customers. In the last three years, this approach has proven itself. Our company is growing fast and, our partners feel that we work together with them as one team. Also, within the nearby universities, our story is getting well known. We are happy that interns find their way to us and deliberately choose Baseflow because ‘ _it’s a chill company’_.
The freedom you get as an employee might be one of the reasons why we are considered a  _chill company_. 10% of your working time, you can do whatever you want because we believe that mixing normal work and 10% time really strengthen each other. But  _having_ freedom is not the same as  _taking_ it. A quick poll in our Slack channel resulted in a score of 45% of people who currently use their 10% time. Let me share what I found out and what we can learn from that.
A couple of examples of things our colleagues are using their time for:
  * Michiel uses his gaming hobby as an inspiration to create a tool for the game Diablo 2 (Resurrected). It helps you to find out what ingredients you need to craft runewords. It's a webpage completely in Diablo 2 style (including a knight glove as mouse pointer 🤩). He sees the project as a fun way to learn. Check it out [here](https://diablo2helper.cerbrus.nl/) or ask Michiel for a demo.
  * Laurens-Jan, has used his time to explore new development technologies. The latest one was [Svelte.](https://svelte.dev/)
  * Bodhi dreamed of visiting Japan, which was his inspiration to create a ‘flash card’ web app to help him learn Japanese. In his words: “all the other tools didn't do what I wanted”. Which developer has not said this and started a project. Take a look at his open sourced (GPL3) code on [GitHub.](https://github.com/BeMacized/ShiraKamiSRS)‍
  * A group of Flutters developers decided to organize Flutter Fridays to discuss architecture, packages, and ways of working. Currently, they're working on documenting guidelines. This allows them to work more efficiently by generating and boilerplate code and helps get new employees up to speed quickly. Moreover, it will get easier for developers to switch between projects since every project should follow the same guidelines.
  * I started following a 3D modeling course to expand my design skills. It wasn't relevant to the work I did at the time, but it so happened to work the other way around. Because of these skills, we explored the possibility to use 3D images on our website, and lo and behold, you can see the results on baseflow.com.


As you can see, the projects are very diverse and the biggest motivation of everyone is self-development. On the other hand, some people don't use their free time. Why's that, and what could help to change that?
  * You’ve got no idea what to do. That is something a lot of people recognize. It’s like getting an assignment at school to write about anything you like. Sometimes the lack of rules makes things harder than having a set of rules. To get started you could try the following: 
  * Explore your passions. Several people are getting inspiration from the interests they have next to their job. What’s something you're passionate about and want to develop? Or open up that drawer, find your bucket list and see if something fits. 
  * Ask others to think along. The creativity of your colleagues will amaze you. A quick question at the coffee machine might kickstart your project.
  * Group up. Working on something together is a great way to keep it ongoing. Also, plan a repeating event in your agendas.


### _“Telling a client that you cannot get the work done because you’re learning how to play the violin is... difficult.”_
‍
Regular work is often taking up all my time. Just like any company, there are project deadlines. The loyalty towards our partners is great, and telling a client that you cannot get the work done because you’re learning to play the violin is difficult. Nevertheless:
  * Plan it. During sprint planning, you plan the amount of work that fits into the upcoming weeks. Take your 10% time into account.
  * Plan it early. That is a tip that Gerwin, one of the co-founders, pointed out once. If you plan your 10% time very early in the sprint (1st or 2nd day) there’s a great chance that unexpected things haven’t happened yet. You might feel more comfortable taking the time.


Half a day per week is too short to get going
  * One day per two weeks might work better. Again, plan it the way it suits you.


All in all, we’re still learning ‘doing whatever’. It has proven to be difficult at times, but it has been fruitful already as well. Mixing 'doing whatever you want' and your normal work gives new insights and more creativity. But maybe the most important thing to realize is that those 40 hours a week tell a lot about you, but do not define you. Especially in these times, it’s important to let your creativity flow, do things you never did, get some fresh air, and keep that mental health at a good level. Maybe we should take that into 2022.

# How to take advantage of Flutter to build amazing cross-platform apps
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/633befa2b6dd1416eb340784_IMGP5875.jpg)
## In this blog post, we will delve into why Flutter is an excellent choice for cross-platform mobile development, its numerous features, and provide you with valuable tips to make the most of it.
### Best cross platform development framework
Cross-platform development frameworks have become increasingly popular as they enable developers to create applications that can run seamlessly on multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, and Windows, with a single codebase. These frameworks are designed to streamline the development process, reduce costs, and accelerate time-to-market for applications. Some of the most popular cross-platform development frameworks include [React Native](https://www.baseflow.com/blogs/flutter-vs-react-native-which-framework-should-you-use-in-2023), [.NET](https://www.baseflow.com/blogs/flutter-vs-net-maui-what-is-the-better-choice-for-2023), and Flutter. Each of these frameworks offers unique benefits and tools, allowing developers to choose the one that best fits their project requirements and preferences.
As a developer seeking to create fantastic cross-platform apps, you should undoubtedly explore the potential of Flutter, as it is currently one of the best multi-platform solutions in cross-platform app development.
### Reasons to Choose Flutter for Cross-Platform Application Development
  1. Impressive, Fast, and Responsive User Interfaces: One of the most significant advantages of Flutter is its ability to create aesthetically pleasing, fast, and responsive user interfaces. This is due to its utilization of the Dart programming language, which compiles down to native code for both iOS and Android. This feature enables you to develop your app using a single codebase while maintaining excellent performance on both platforms.
  2. Hot Reload Feature: Another reason to choose Flutter for cross-platform app development is its hot reload functionality. This feature enables you to make changes to your code and instantly see the results without restarting your app. Hot reload can save you considerable time during development as you can rapidly test new features and fix bugs in real-time.

### Essential Tips for Harnessing the Power of Flutter
#### Use Material Design Widgets
Material Design is a design system developed by Google that aims to create a unified user experience across platforms and devices. Flutter comes equipped with a set of pre-built widgets that adhere to Material Design guidelines, such as RaisedButton, AppBar, and FloatingActionButton. By using these widgets, you can create visually appealing and consistent user interfaces across both iOS and Android platforms. Moreover, Material Design guidelines provide recommendations for layout, color, typography, and interaction patterns, ensuring that your app has a modern and intuitive design.

Some of the Material Design components
#### Leverage Hot Reload
Hot reload is a powerful feature in Flutter that significantly improves the development experience. When you make changes to your code, hot reload updates the app's UI instantly without requiring a full app restart. This functionality allows for rapid feature testing, real-time bug fixes, and a more efficient development process. To make the most of hot reload, ensure that your app's state is well-managed, and avoid practices that could cause unintended side effects, such as using static variables or global keys.
#### Utilize the Right Tools
A plethora of excellent tools are available for Flutter development, such as the Flutter Inspector, Dart DevTools, and IDE integrations. The Flutter Inspector allows you to visualize and explore the widget tree, inspect individual widgets, and diagnose layout issues. Dart DevTools, on the other hand, is a suite of performance and debugging tools that help you profile app performance, track memory usage, and debug network issues. IDE integrations, such as those for Visual Studio Code and Android Studio, can enhance your development experience by providing code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging support.
#### Write Comprehensive Unit Tests
Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that your code functions as intended and is maintainable. In Flutter, unit tests focus on individual functions, classes, or libraries, verifying that they behave correctly in isolation. To write unit tests, you can use the 'test' package that provides a rich set of testing functions and assertions. Writing comprehensive unit tests helps catch bugs early in the development process and prevents them from reaching your end-users.
#### Conduct Widget Tests
Widget tests are an essential part of testing the UI of your app. In Flutter, widget tests simulate user interactions and verify that your app's UI behaves as expected. These tests ensure that your app's UI remains consistent across various devices and platforms, providing an optimal user experience. The 'flutter_test' package provides a WidgetTester class that allows you to create a test environment for widgets, perform actions like tapping or dragging, and check the widget tree for specific conditions.
#### Explore Official Flutter Documentation and Resources
The official Flutter documentation and resources offer valuable information and best practices to help you harness the full power of Flutter. The documentation covers a wide range of topics, such as architecture, state management, and navigation, while the resources include sample apps, tutorials, and videos. Make sure to consult these materials for deeper insights and practical guidance on using Flutter effectively.
### Conclusion
By following these tips and harnessing the power of Flutter, you can create exceptional cross-platform apps that stand out in a crowded market. Stay updated with the latest Flutter features and best practices to keep your app development skills sharp and relevant.

# Introducing our Head of Culture!
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63dbbf64e33ce3eca575f9bc_IMG_0489%20\(5\)sdafs.jpg)
## Introducing our new 'Head of Culture!'
From the very first day, it was clear to us that at Baseflow, it's all about people first, followed by technology and processes. To perform at our maximum, our people must be able to perform at their best. This has resulted in our "[people first](https://www.baseflow.com/about)" policy, where our people come first. This is not just about good coffee, a nice office, and fun company outings (although we have all these things 😆). It's about having fun in daily work, professionally and personally developing oneself, and feeling the freedom to always be yourself.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63dbb1269d251821fb580227_IMGP5537-_1_.webp)
This is reflected in our employment conditions: [10% creative time](https://www.baseflow.com/blogs/how-to-fill-free-time) and unlimited paid time off, amongst others. But you mostly see it in the Baseflow culture: friendly, open, curious, and always looking ahead.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63dbb1437e4449f6439cf084_IMGP5839-_1_.webp)
But how do you ensure that this culture remains in a rapidly growing organization? How do you safeguard something that is not as tangible as a culture?
In addition to our people, our culture is Baseflow's most valuable asset, requiring constant attention and care. And it will continue to develop along with all our people.
To ensure this, we have concluded that there must be someone in the organization who entirely focuses on our culture. Someone fully focused on caring for, enriching, and protecting our culture. Because we want to continue to offer the best work environment for our people and, therefore, the best for our customers.
I am therefore thrilled to introduce Maartje Mutter as Baseflow's "Head of Culture." Maartje has been working at Baseflow for several years and is an expert in our culture. She has always been interested in everything that makes our culture what it is. On the one hand, she will be dealing with very practical matters ("maybe we should try to write down what our culture is"), but she will also be more outward-facing with our story. And a lot of other things, but that's for another time.

In short: we are super happy that Maartje is going to fill this role at Baseflow!

# Kanban vs Scrum: A Guide to Choosing the Right Agile Methodology
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/649a9d7c1090911edd256fe7_whiteboard-4054377_1280.jpg)
## Let's take an in-depth look at Scrum versus Kanban, their unique roles, and when to use Scrum vs Kanban.
In the world of project management, Kanban and Scrum are two methodologies often brought up in the same breath. As both stem from the Agile philosophy, it's no surprise that they share some similarities. But there are differences between Scrum and Kanban that can be pivotal in deciding which to implement in your project environment. 
### **A More Detailed Look at Kanban**
Originating from the Japanese automotive industry, Kanban made its way into software development and project management as a means to optimize workflow, reduce waste, and improve efficiency.
Kanban operates under a visual system, typically embodied in a Kanban board, to manage work as it moves through a process. The board is divided into different stages, representing the progression of tasks from inception to completion. Tasks are symbolized by cards and move along the board from one stage to another, visually representing the workflow.
A critical aspect of Kanban is its focus on limiting work-in-progress (WIP). Each stage of the workflow has a limit on the number of tasks that can be within it at a time. By capping the amount of work in progress, Kanban encourages teams to focus on finishing tasks rather than starting new ones, thus ensuring a smoother flow of work and reducing the time it takes for a task to move from start to finish.
Unlike Scrum, Kanban doesn't prescribe specific roles. Instead, all members of a Kanban team share the responsibility for monitoring and managing the flow of work. This aspect encourages a high degree of collaboration and flexibility within the team, as there is a shared sense of ownership and accountability.
### **Understanding Scrum**
Unlike Kanban, Scrum is built on the premise of iterations, known as sprints. This begs the question: does Kanban have sprints? The short answer is no, it doesn’t. Kanban promotes a continuous flow of work, while Scrum follows a sprint-based structure. Sprints in Scrum are time-boxed iterations that usually last for a set period, commonly two weeks.
The Scrum Kanban board and the Kanban board function similarly but are tailored to their respective methodologies. The scrum board resets after each sprint, while the Kanban board is a continuous flow. Thus, comparing a Kanban board vs sprint board, or the other way round, is essentially a matter of preference based on the specific project needs.
### **Key Differences Between Scrum and Kanban**
While understanding the Agile methodology, Scrum vs Kanban becomes an essential conversation. It helps to understand the difference between Scrum and Kanban, and the difference between a task board and Kanban.
Scrum relies on fixed roles and routines, with the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team all playing defined roles. Conversely, Kanban roles are less rigid and more adaptable to changes. This can sometimes lead to confusion regarding the Kanban roles and responsibilities, but the flexibility is also one of its strengths.
Scrum and Kanban also differ in how they approach progress. As mentioned, Scrum uses sprints to organise work and track progress. Therefore, you can see a Kanban vs sprint scenario in Scrum and Kanban, respectively. Kanban does not use sprints; instead, it visualises the workflow on a Kanban board, marking progress as tasks move across the board.
### **Scrum vs Kanban: Which One to Use?**
When to use Kanban vs Scrum depends on your team, the project, and the work environment. Kanban is ideal when work arrives unpredictably, or the priority shifts quickly. It provides flexibility and allows for quick response to changes. Thus, when considering Kanban or Scrum, remember that Kanban is perfect for dynamic environments.
On the other hand, Scrum is better suited for projects where the requirements are unlikely to change drastically. The predictability of work makes Scrum's time-boxed sprints ideal. 
In the debate between a Scrum board or Kanban board, the decision largely depends on your requirements and the nature of the tasks at hand. A Scrum board is usually divided into "To Do", "Doing", and "Done" columns, but customizable stages do exist such as "Test" and "Staging" and it gets reset at the end of each sprint (if every task is done). Conversely, a Kanban board includes more process stages by default(e.g., "Backlog", "Ready", "Coding", "Testing", "Done") and doesn't reset.
When comparing the Kanban board vs Scrum board, it's important to note that Kanban boards provide a higher degree of visualisation with a continious flow, whereas a Scrum board provides a a visualisation of the current sprint.
### **Do You Have to Choose Between Scrum and Kanban?**
While it's helpful to compare Kanban vs Scrum, it's not always necessary to choose one over the other. Some teams find a blended approach, often called Scrumban, works best. In this model, the Scrum framework is used as a starting point, but Kanban practices are introduced to help visualise work, limit work-in-progress, and improve flow. The Kanban Scrum Master can thus play a vital role in managing such a hybrid process.
Scrumban leverages the structure of Scrum with the flexibility and visualisation of Kanban, allowing teams to adapt and change their working methods according to the project's evolution. This amalgamation often answers the question, 'When to use Kanban vs Scrum?' as it takes the best of both worlds, creating a dynamic, flexible, yet controlled environment.
### **Sprints vs Kanban: Final Thoughts**
In the sprints vs Kanban or Kanban vs sprints discussion, it's clear that both methodologies have their strengths and can be extremely effective when applied in the right context. If your team values adaptability and needs to respond to changing priorities quickly, then the continuous flow of Kanban may be the ideal choice. If, however, your team benefits from a structured approach and clearly defined roles with regular reviews and retrospectives, then Scrum with its sprint cycles would be more suitable.
While it can be challenging to decide between a sprint vs Kanban or whether to implement a Scrum board or Kanban board, the goal is to select the approach that will offer the most value and drive productivity for your team. Understanding the differences between Scrum and Kanban, along with your team's unique needs and capabilities, will help guide your decision.
Remember, Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban are designed to be flexible and iterative, so don't be afraid to experiment, inspect, and adapt to find the perfect fit for your project.

# Managing Mugs: Decoupling Frontend and Backend Development
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6368c58877db577c5453e3e9_IMG_20221028_092717686_50.webp)
## How can the frontend team continue developing new features, without being blocked by the backend? We need a way to decouple the teams.
### Introduction
Imagine: you just started working on a new project for a client as a Flutter developer. As it is a rather large project, the client hired a dedicated frontend team and a dedicated backend team. As you are working with Flutter, within weeks, the frontend team is miles ahead of the backend team in terms of features. Only later will the frontend team be tasked with frontend-heavy features, allowing the backend team to catch up. How can the frontend team continue developing new features without being blocked by the backend? We need a way to decouple the teams. This blog will describe API specifications, mocking backends using imposter, and end-to-end tests. And what better way to illustrate my point than a little case study?
### Case Study: Managing Mugs
To illustrate the steps that we will take, I require a case study. Here at Baseflow, everyone has a personalized mug. You can tell my mug apart from the other mugs because mine uniquely has my name on it. We will create an application for this blog to manage mug ’objects.’ I made a GitHub repository containing the Mug Manager application we are about to build at<https://github.com/Baseflow/mug-manager>.
### API Specifications
Before the backend team starts implementing a feature, writing the API (Application Programming Interface) specifications is good practice. These specs act as a contract between the frontend and backend and dictate what is sent and received between the application and the server. Including frontend and backend developers in this process is valuable so they can weigh in on considerations from both ends. By writing out the specifications, either team can start working on the feature as they know which data they will receive and send.
OpenAPI is an industry standard for writing APIs. An online editor can be found at <https://editor.swagger.io/>. In OpenAPI, you can specify your endpoints and show example requests and responses. Let’s get to work on our mug manager. We leave authentication out of the equation and assume that users are somehow authenticated. We start by defining the Mug model. Mugs at Baseflow consist of a first name, last name, and optional nickname. Sometimes, a colleague drops a mug when clearing out the dishwasher, breaking it. Therefore we would like to store a boolean to indicate whether the mug is broken. We also give mugs a unique identifier. We put this information in the OpenAPI spec.

Mug model in OpenAPI
Now that we have our mug model let’s define some endpoints. We define GET /mug to read all mugs from a database, POST /mug to create a new mug, PUT /mug/{mugId} to update an existing mug, and DELETE /mug/{mugId} to delete a mug. We can define route parameters, request body, and responses.

The OpenAPI spec can be found in the GitHub repository at [/imposter/mug.yaml](https://github.com/Baseflow/mug-manager/blob/main/imposter/mug.yaml).
### Implementing a Mock Server Using Imposter
Now that the contract has been established as an OpenAPI specification, the backend and frontend teams can work on the feature separately. The backend team could even decide to skip this feature for now and focus on something else. Great! But once the frontend team has finished their implementation, they want to test and demo their work. The most straightforward approach would be to write a bit of code that manages data in memory. But if they're going to do it properly, they could also implement a mock server. A mock server is a separate program that pretends to be the backend. For our mug manager, we will use imposter (<https://www.imposter.sh/>). The imposter can generate a mock backend from the OpenAPI spec we created! We create a config file pointing imposter to the specs.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6368c6dce17d1b62b94c977d_1mQ--IakivgM28XCrGxG46LAMDgblLELY91mZaXs87hPq7tsZgIWyvQu2MFVF9iq0VzV8FzB6zUSxPDZRJ_x6NOWJwDcpUtAyEYOsoNQH61Pa5ITm_KQ3akRF9l86UnZvqJejKm_orew2ZnwoKCUov9hyqJ32o8thyoi9JEkDJQtbeuj8SIdJP4SqR56Dg.png)
Now we can start imposter using the Imposter CLI by running imposter up -p 8080. A backend server will be created on your machine at localhost:8080. For now, imposter will output default responses without keeping the state. To quickly test our implementation, we will use Postman (<https://www.postman.com/>). Postman allows us to talk to the backend easily.

Firing POST from Postman to Imposter
We want more, however. The mock backend should also use some form of in-memory storage so we can create, update and delete mugs during a demo as if there was an actual backend. Luckily, imposter gives us fine-grained control with unlimited possibilities as it allows scripting. By providing Groovy or Javascript code, we can customize imposter in any way we want.

Scripting Imposter to generate a mug identifier on creation
Using Postman, we test the POST route again. The response from imposter contains HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the created mug as content. We can see that the script generated the id, indicating that responses are no longer static.

Firing POST from Postman to updated Imposter
‍
All Imposter codes can be found under[/imposter](https://github.com/Baseflow/mug-manager/tree/main/imposter). As we finish the mock backend, it is time to connect to it in Flutter!
### Talking to the Backend in Flutter
When implementing a data layer, it can be essential to make a clear distinction between core layer code and data layer code. We want to communicate to a backend over HTTP for this case study. But, in the future, we might want to communicate with a local caching service that occasionally sends HTTP requests. Or we might want to store all the data locally. The code in the core layer will contain the mug model and related business logic.
In contrast, the data layer implements data layer-specific functionality, such as converting mugs to and from JSON. The core code will contain a Mug model and a Mug repository. The Mug model includes all fields of a mug. First name, last name, nickname, whether it is broken, and an id. The repository is an interface that declares methods such as createMug(), updateMug(), and deleteMug(). Then, in the data layer, we create specific HTTP instantiations of these classes. We make an HttpMug model that contains logic to translate the mug object to and from JSON so that we can send it over the web. We also create an HttpMugRepository that uses an HTTP client to send and receive data from a backend. Our code becomes loosely coupled by clearly splitting the core and data layers. We can quickly implement a different data layer in the future that will not affect the core code, and we can test business logic and data-specific features separately.

All Flutter-related code can be found in the repository under[/lib](https://github.com/Baseflow/mug-manager/tree/main/lib).
### End-to-End Testing
Now that we have both the Imposter backend and a working application, we can write end-to-end tests. End-to-end tests are the closest to a real-world interaction with an app. You can view them as a person opening your app and using it. Contrary to unit tests that test only small, contained pieces of code, end-to-end tests start an instance of the application, interact with the user interface and check whether the app behaves as expected. For end-to-end tests, all services used by the application should be available. Usually, this includes a backend. It is bad practice to use the actual backend during tests. Tests will be slow due to communication over the internet, and backend calls may incur financial costs.
Additionally, the database keeps state, which is not ideal when testing for deterministic behavior. As our app requires a backend, nonetheless, using the mock backend instead is perfect. We can run it locally before running the tests. It is quick, costless, and can easily be wiped clean.
You could automate the starting Imposter before running the tests, but we will not go into that here. Our tests will assume that Imposter is up and running before testing if users can create, update and delete mugs.

End-to-end test for creating a mug
The end-to-end tests can be found in the repository at [/integration_test/app_test.dart](https://github.com/Baseflow/mug-manager/blob/main/integration_test/app_test.dart).
### Outro
In this blog, we developed a mug manager application to demonstrate how we can decouple frontend and backend work as much as possible. We created an OpenAPI spec and a mock backend. Aside from decoupling, we also made end-to-end tests by using the mock backend as a drop-in replacement for an actual backend.

# Mobile video matters
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/602169a0c4d13593bf75b521_Mobile-Matters-Header.jpg)
## Baseflow's recognises the importance of playing videos on mobile devices that's why we made the MediaManger plugin for Xamarin. Want to know more about it?
**Videos are a vital part of the online experience. The usage, spend, and consumption of videos online is only set to increase. Playing videos seamlessly on any device is the key to successfully engaging with your audience. MediaManager is a plugin built with Xamarin that is a game-changer when it comes to building media players into your apps.**
Martijn van Dijk co-founder of Baseflow and his team recognise the importance of playing videos on mobile devices. They have worked hard to make it easier for developers to integrate video and audio functionality into apps easily. The MediaManager is a Xamarin plugin that can play any media (audio, video) from one codebase. It is the only media player plugin that is packed full of features to enable you to do this in your own apps. There is no standard way to do cross-platform media playing in Xamarin, but instead of writing hundreds or thousands of lines of code to create a media player, you now only need 1 line of code.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6021705488e1705089148dda_stats-on-video.png)
It is designed to be easy-to-use and straightforward, with early releases enabling the following features: Native playback of media files from remote and local sources Native media notifications and remote controlsPlayback status (Playing, Buffering, Loading, Paused, Progress)
In the latest update, the new features are:The update was based on .NET StandardNow uses Exoplayer to on AndroidFurther options to control playback and media managementIt also works for Tizen and WPFYou can use the system controls, or you can make them yourself with your own graphics
### **Why the .Net standard?**
People have been waiting for a long time on an update with .NET standard, and now it's here!
### **ExoPlayer on ANDROID**
According to Martijn, the built-in media player on Android is unstable and sometimes unreliable. Google made an ExoPlayer, a native library that people can include in their app. Martijn says, 'The Exoplayer library is written in Java. We at Baseflow have made a binding library for it so you can use it in Xamarin. Now we have based EXO on med, and it gives a better performance more stable and better features."

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/602170f5ba84fe4552bdb62c_video_infographic-blog.png)
### **Everybody shufflin'**
The new control playback features about you to shuffle the content in your queue. Unlike other services offering the 'shuffle' option where you may find the same 30 to 35 tracks on repeat, the shuffle function on MediaManager is genuinely random. Read the technical detail here.
### Working with Tizen and WPF
The more platforms made available to work with, the easier it is to make your app available everywhere.
Android and IOS might dominate the mobile market, but there is still plenty of people using Windows and Samsung devices. Part of the Baseflow mission is to build software that is compatible with all devices. 
The control is in entirely in the users' hands 
If you are using audio or video functionality in your Xamarin apps, you should be using Media Manager. It has all sorts of options to enrich the playback experience. You can control your media, hit play, pause, stop or go to the next video. There are a lot of things you need to think about when playing media. Do you want the video to remain playing in the background, what permissions are required for the app to function, are remote controls a function to consider? With the MediaManager anything is possible. 
Let's take a look at the Chameleon Media Player powered by Baseflow.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/602171b1182ae0c430716447_Chameleon-mediaplayer.png)
This app is a brilliant expression of all the possibilities that MediaManager has to offer. [The Chameleon Player](https://github.com/BaseflowIT/Chameleon) uses a clean interface with the skip, skip back, next, previous and play buttons with all controls highlighted in red accents. It's a familiar yet unique interface.
With MediaManager you can personalise or brand your own content experience however you imagine. MediaManager can handle all media situations that you can integrate it into your app.
### **Future Features**
Metadata is still essential when it comes to SEO because we have moved beyond Meta content type, meta descriptions and titles. Imagine being able to automatically extract metadata such as spoken words, written text, emotions, topics and scenes from video and audio files using AI. This feature will allow you to enhance your search experiences, search by spoken word, entity, or emotion. 
The same AI can help make your content more user-friendly. [Repurpose your content](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/video-indexer) across multiple audiences using the speech transcription and translation functions to add closed captioning for multiple languages easily. Improve recommendation algorithms by the people and emotions that appear in a video, and automatically create clips with the sections featuring a particular person. You can create new content out of your existing content with ease! Reuse the Video Indexer portal widgets on your applications without building the underlying infrastructure.
**Video**
Both your eyes and ears are engaged when playing video. However, your attention can dip in and about while you watch something. Life is full of interruptions, especially on your mobile. The way you interact with video does not have to be determined by the interruptions you receive. With the MediaManager, your video can do what you want it to do. You can continue playing it minimised in the background while you listen to it, and you can return to watching it when you want. Respond to that text, like or comment on a photo when you receive that notification and then return to the video you were watching. The MediaManager makes it simple.
There is a lot of material online in content marketing spheres about the importance of video. The importance of video is unquestionable. But there is a lot of focus on what people should be watching or the kind of content you should be making. Martijn Van Dijk says, "The reality is content is no longer king. Audiences have such diverse and unique tastes, and their desires are being made into watchable content. The 'what' people are watching is not where we place our focus. At Baseflow, we want to steer the conversation towards the 'how'. The fact is people are more likely to watch a video on their mobile, and a third of the time people spend online is watching videos. That is a behaviour you cannot ignore and what we are thinking about when we build and add features to MediaManager. How does someone best enjoy their video experience? There is no single answer, but we feel the MediaManager gives users all the options to make their own experiences genuinely personal.
**Audio**
While the focus of this article has been on the awesomeness of mobile video, audio still plays a massive role in the time and type of media people consume on their mobiles.
The Chameleon MediaPlayer allows some new options for the commuter. You can subscribe to all of your favourite podcast shows and resume playing from last time you were listening. While this is a pretty standard feature, the Dead air trimmer will cut silences longer than any time you wish to set personally. The Audio boost also can automatically use the equaliser to enhance voice while you listen. You can also set the playtime to match your commute duration, set the kind of podcast type you wish to listen too. You can even start episodes after a fixed amount of time, set per show. Skip standard intro's, ads, and listen to what you want! 
### How do I implement this into my current Xamarin app now?
To get started, all you need to do is [[download the plugin from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Plugin.MediaManager) and install it into each project that utilises MediaManager. 
The current version is 0.8.7, so the plan is to release 1.0 as a stable release somewhere in the next few months.
If you want to learn more about media playback, make sure to follow me on Twitter at @baseflowIT to receive updates. Future plans include support for Android Auto, Chromecast, CarPlay, and seamless switching between output sources such as Bluetooth, TV, or DLNA. If you have ideas, find bugs, or want to help with development, make sure to check out the source code on GitHub.
**How do I find out more**
Install the NuGet package. There is a lot of information in the readme: <https://github.com/martijn00/XamarinMediaManager>*
 **It's open-source and free**
**MediaManager In Action: Chameleon Media Player App!**
This application makes sure you always have the media that you need at hand. It runs on all your devices and is relevant per device. Create personalised streams of content from any source and share it with anyone.

# My internship during the pandemic
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/62ff65ead8582762513d1948_61fbef2790f539680c07a009_desktop-header-laura.jpeg)
## Finding a suitable internship during COVID-19 is not easy. I invested a lot of time in contacting organizations that might be interesting to me. Ten job applications later, I finally found an organization that matched my preferences. Unfortunately, this was not for a long time. This company canceled my internship, and I was right back where I started.
Finding a suitable internship during COVID-19 was not easy. I invested a lot of time in contacting organizations that might be interesting to me. Ten job applications later, I finally found an organization that matched my preferences. Unfortunately, this was not for a long time. This company canceled my internship, and I was right back where I started.
The search continued, and again I sent tens of job applications. Unfortunately, it was not successful. In the end, I decided to delay my internship and turn my school route. I followed my last lessons and continued my search. In the meantime, Baseflow crossed my path. Martijn (co-founder) had seen my LinkedIn post and invited me for a job interview. At the interview, I realized that Baseflow was the company I was looking for! I came to work in a great team, and I got a challenging assignment. In the end, it turned out well that I turned my school route because the extra theoretical knowledge turned out to be useful.
**Culture**
Once I started working, I was looking for structure. I was used to a hierarchical culture where they told you what and how to do your work. Baseflow offers a lot of freedom and flexibility. It took some time to get used to it. Right now, I am used to the Baseflow culture, and I realized that this way of working is rare. I never want to go back to a hierarchical culture.
**Binsend**
My internship was devoted to Binsend. As a subsidiary of Baseflow, Binsend is a platform that allows you to send documents to different people, easy and securely. At the start of my internship, Binsend was still a young company. It was my job to put a product on the market out of nothing. In the beginning, I researched a lot because this kind of project was new to me, and nobody else was working on it yet.
Based on the target group and competitor's research, it became clear which direction we wanted to go with Binsend. We concluded a few things: we did not speak the language of our target group, we did not know what aspects they would find important in a product like Binsend, whether the platform is clearly to understand, how their workflow would look like, and also how they usually come in touch with a new product. To receive all this knowledge, I went with my colleagues to various accountancy and administration offices to talk with them. Many interesting things came out of these conversations: including an event focused on accountants, the Accountancy Expo.
The Accountancy Expo was important to us because it gave us a deadline l to set things up. Many things needed to be completed, and we finished the tasks very well with the Binsend team. We can be very proud of ourselves.
**Throwback**
When I look back on my internship, I got an opportunity to discover what my strengths and interests are. I am someone who likes to do many different tasks. During my internship, I started to see myself more as a generalist. For this reason, the Binsend assignment suited me so well. I got to do so many different things, which is super cool during an internship.
In the meantime, I got a job offer as a working student, and I will also graduate at Baseflow. My graduation assignment already looks super cool. More about this will follow later :)

# Progress made to Cached­Network­Image
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60216b599f28f63e72ddd9af_Rene-Blog-header.jpg)
## CachedNetworkImage now exceeds the 1.1k Github Stars and still belongs to the top packages on pub. 
At this moment, we are in a worldwide healthcare crisis due to coronavirus. As we developers already know, the whole world knows by now: “Testing, testing, testing” is critical, and we know we should do that, but not many of us have adequate test coverage. When a package becomes as popular as CachedNetworkImage, it is essential to test all the cases, so new functionality doesn’t break anything for existing users. CachedNetworkImage now exceeds the 1.1k Github Stars and still belongs to the top packages on [pub](https://pub.dev). 
### Testing, testing, testing
Before we focus on the new functionality of CachedNetworkImage, we want to improve the quality of the packages that support our beautiful images, flutter_cache_manager. For a package used by so many people, it had terrifyingly few tests: 0. We are proud to announce that we brought the test coverage from 0% to 81% in the latest release. Next to testing, we also added lots of rules in the analysis_options.yaml file, which didn’t even exist, which helped us solve some potential bugs. It can’t be emphasized enough how important it is to add at least a minimal set of analysis options and to write tests for your code early on. An excellent place to start with the analysis options is to add the pedantic set as advised by the [dart team](https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options).

### Updates on your download progress
One of the things we did rewrite with the help of the community is the FileFetcher. Previously you could supply your own FileFetcher to change the default http client, but you could only provide full-size content and headers. This setup makes it inefficient and hard to manage. For example, when you want to change the max-age of your object, you have to change the headers, which is not something you should be doing. The new FileService asks you to extract all the headers but gives you also the option to manipulate them as you want. For example, when you expect a particular file extension that doesn’t match the http content-type, you can do that. We also no longer expect the full-size content, but a stream of the content. When you still use the now deprecated FileFetcher, the content will be supplied as a stream with only one emitting value.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/602178fc01487b56d6a4327d_downloading.gif)
The content stream has two implications on how the content is handled. First, the library directly writes content to a file on disk, while the content is streaming from the webserver to the application. Doing so reduces the amount of memory used by the library as it no longer has to keep the whole file in memory before it is stored. Doing so in the old situation would introduce significant risk. The CacheManager used to keep the file name constant while updating the content. If you had an outdated file in your cache and the server gave you an update, it would overwrite the outdated file. In the old situation, we only risked an IO exception to lose your old file. In the new situation, we would risk any unstable internet connection to fail the download and storage of the file. So now, we always store the data in a new file, and when that file is successfully saved, we update the cache information and delete the old file. This whole process of changing the content to a stream is made so much easier by the tests we have written before that we could very easily test most of the cases and are sure that it works as intended.
This change of content to a stream gave us also the option for a much-requested feature in CachedNetworkImage: the download progress. As we already have a stream in place, we can easily supply that information to the CachedNetworkImage. In CachedNetworkImage we now added the option to add a progress indicator like this:
This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters. [Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters](https://github.co/hiddenchars)

CachedNetworkImage(

imageUrl: "http://via.placeholder.com/350x150",  
progressIndicatorBuilder: (context, url, downloadProgress) =>  
CircularProgressIndicator(value: downloadProgress.progress),  
errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),  
);

‍
We deliberately added a progressIndicatorBuilder to the existing placeholder as the behavior is different. The progress indicator rebuilds very often with every status update it receives, while the placeholder is built once and kept until the image is fully fetched. When you don’t use the progress to show to the user, the placeholder is thus the more efficient and preferred way. The download progress gives you the bytes downloaded, the total size of the file, and the progress as a percentage. See the [doc](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_cache_manager/latest/flutter_cache_manager/DownloadProgress-class.html) for more information. 
### ContentTypes
What the library does not fix, however, is just plain wrong content. This sounds obvious, but we still get a lot of requests to do that. There are two types of things going wrong often. First, is the server supplying the wrong content-type? I have seen servers supplying mp3 files with content-type application/octet-stream. Fixing this is not something we would even want to start with, so make sure your server supplies the right headers for the content you request. If you don’t have access to the server, you could always consider downloading the files and storing them yourselves on your server. Or, if you know the content-type beforehand, you can now manipulate the fileExtension by supplying your FileService as told earlier.
**The second thing** the library cannot fix for you is if you expect an image but download an html page. For example, this url looks like an image but is actually an HTML page with an image on it: 
<https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/examples/flutter_view/assets/flutter-mark-square-64.png>
Always make sure to correctly link to the image so that only the image is downloaded. Some servers don’t serve 404 status codes when an image is not found, but a 404 web page with a status code 200. This can also lead to unexpected results as the CacheManager thinks it successfully downloaded the file and will not try to update it before max-age is reached. So bottom line, always make sure the server sends the information the way the web standards expect it.
### And next
The changes discussed in this article are released as flutter_cache_manager 1.2, and the progress indicator can be used with cached_network_image 2.1. Now that we largely improved the quality of the CacheManager, we can continue with improving the quality of CachedNetworkImage. Going through the whole process again, we will write tests, improve the code quality, and add features when opportunities arrive. Creating a good foundation will give us the possibility to quickly add new features in the future.

# Rust ownership model and the borrow checker
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64882360f530aef2735a5a6a_05.png)
## We’ll dive deep into the Rust borrow checker and explore how it works, what benefits it provides, and how it can sometimes be challenging to work with.
Rust is a systems programming language that has gained popularity in recent years due to its strong focus on safety, performance, and concurrency. One of the key features that sets Rust apart from other languages is its borrow checker. The borrow checker is a type of static analysis tool that helps prevent common errors such as null pointer dereferences, use-after-free bugs, and data races. Whether you’re a seasoned Rustacean or just getting started with the language, this post will provide valuable insights into one of Rust’s most powerful and unique features.
### The stack vs the heap
It’s important to note the distinction between memory that’s allocated on the stack and memory that’s allocated on the heap.
### The stack
Imagine the following code
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487143bab23e703497b0497_carbon%20\(11\).png)
You can see this as a sheet of paper, where containing the following items.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487154a618ad3f15b0c129c_01.png)
The stack now looks like this.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487155093d22a50714b78c6_02.png)
If we add a method and then call it, there will be a change.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871584cc31c0c914182227_carbon%20\(12\).png)
When a method is called, a new scope is created. You can think of each new scope as a fresh sheet of paper being added to the top of the stack.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487159a053f3e746ea792b3_03.png)
And the stack now looks like this:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648715b5bffc9c629e5539c1_04.png)
When a method is called, two new items are added to the stack memory to represent the method’s arguments and local variables. However, as soon as we exit the method’s scope by reaching the closing curly brace, everything inside that scope is destroyed, including any values that were allocated on the stack such as x and y. These values are no longer considered alive and cannot be accessed or used after the scope has ended.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648715c6d2f51a223de0c6ec_05.png)
The stack now looks like this again.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648715dae4fc3e7d2580b561_06.png)
It’s worth noting that the compiler can preallocate memory for the stack since all items we assign to have a fixed size. For example, the value var_a is of type i8, so it will always use 8 bits in memory no matter how large the number is. However, the stack can only be used for fixed-sized allocations, and items on the stack are placed next to each other, leaving no room for expansion at runtime. Accessing and copying values from/to the stack is therefore very fast and cheap.
Rust always defaults to allocating memory on the stack whenever possible, unless the programmer specifies otherwise. This contributes to Rust’s memory safety and performance gains. However, collections like String, which is a collection of u8’s, can grow in size and cannot be placed on the stack. For this reason, we need to use the heap.
### The heap
The heap is used for values that can grow or shrink in size and need to be passed around between scopes. You can think of the heap as a row of lockers that can be used to store items of various sizes. When we allocate memory on the heap, we request a block of memory of a certain size, and the operating system finds a suitable spot to place that block.
Unlike the stack, which is managed automatically by the Rust compiler, heap memory must be manually allocated and deallocated using special functions. This introduces some complexities, such as the possibility of memory leaks or dangling pointers, which can cause bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules help to prevent these issues and ensure that memory is managed safely and efficiently.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487160c82e5860a12a95f5c_carbon%20\(13\).png)
The String value is different from other fixed-size values like i8 because it can be modified, causing the size of the allocated memory to increase or decrease. Therefore, it cannot be placed on the stack. Instead, var_b is placed on the heap, where it can be represented as a pointer to the start of the allocated memory block, along with metadata that specifies the size and capacity of the block.
Heap-allocated values like var_b must be explicitly deallocated when they are no longer needed. If a heap-allocated value is not properly deallocated, it can lead to memory leaks or other issues. Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules help to prevent these issues by ensuring that heap-allocated values are properly managed and deallocated when they are no longer needed.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487162d86e9f3861fa7443f_07.png)
As you can see, var_b now contains a pointer that references memory on the heap, along with metadata that specifies the length and capacity of the allocated block. If we were to change “Hello” to “Hell”, the length of the allocated memory for that item would be altered to 4.
Memory allocations on the heap are more expensive than memory allocations on the stack because they require more management. In most modern programming languages, a garbage collector takes care of this management. However, garbage collection can introduce pauses in the program execution, making it unsuitable for system programming.
Rust doesn’t have a garbage collector, but it does take care of memory management for you. This is where Rust’s flagship feature, the ownership model, comes in. The ownership model ensures that each value in memory has a unique owner, and that ownership can be transferred between different parts of the program. By doing so, Rust ensures that memory is managed efficiently and without introducing any run-time overhead, making it a great choice for systems programming.
### Rust ownership model
The Rust ownership model has a few key features that make it unique and powerful:
  * There is only one owner for allocated memory, whether it’s on the stack or the heap.
  * Memory is always freed as soon as the owner is removed from the stack.


This simplicity allows Rust to guarantee memory safety without the need for a garbage collector. When an owner is removed from the stack, Rust automatically frees the memory associated with that owner. This makes Rust code both safe and efficient, as memory is always managed correctly without any overhead from a garbage collector.
The ownership model is enforced through Rust’s borrowing system, which allows for flexible and safe sharing of memory between different parts of the program.
In the next sections, we’ll dive deeper into the details of Rust’s ownership model and borrowing system, and how they work together to make Rust code safe and efficient.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648716a5539f7d0726fc214d_carbon%20\(14\).png)
Question: who is the owner of the initial value 6?
In this case a copy is made when assigning var_b of the value of var_a Remember: it’s so cheap and fast to have values on the stack, rust will just copy the value to a new value to the stack whenever possible. So now, we have 2 values on the stack. var_a owns a value 6, and var_b also owns another value of 6.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648716c1ff89b11d46a24675_08.png)
This also applies when moving stack allocations to other scopes like a method call:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648716f020df97f81fd73ff8_carbon%20\(15\).png)
The output will be:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487173cebb6e36f3d3c2bc0_carbon%20\(16\).png)
This is because a clone is made of var_a, and passed in to some_other_function and given ownership to parameter val. There is no correlation between var_a and val in this case. Remember this copy action, we will see this later on some more.
### A more complex example
So if we have the following example:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648717623b3f995e8d7a33c4_carbon%20\(17\).png)
Our stack and heap memory now looks like this:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487177d9ff37f2fb0dc350c_09.png)
But as soon as we hit the end of the some_other_function() scope (at the curly braces),
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648717a1e4fc3e7d25832796_carbon%20\(18\).png)
var_x is removed from the stack, and therefore its corresponding allocated memory on the heap is also removed. This process of deallocating memory on the heap is straightforward in Rust.
In Rust, ownership of allocated memory can be transferred or moved between variables.
See the following example:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648717c2efc3a938db540301_carbon%20\(19\).png)
Nothing new here, right? As expected, the string ‘Hello’ will be printed to the console.
However, something changed here. The ownership of the allocated memory moved from var_b to input. Let’s see what happens if we try to use var_b after the some_other_function() call’.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648717ddebdb29c0ffeb8dd1_carbon%20\(20\).png)
After the ownership of the allocated memory for var_b is moved to the input variable in the some_other_function() call, Rust does not allow var_b to be used anymore. This is because the ownership of var_b has been transferred and it no longer owns the memory. When trying to use var_b after the function call, the compiler detects that it has been moved and will complain about a borrow after the move error.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487180f4217723104186592_carbon%20\(21\).png)
**WHAT???**
As mentioned earlier, in Rust, items are removed when their owner is removed. In the example, we moved the ownership of “Hello” from the var_b variable to input parameter. The input parameter only lives during the scope of the some_other_function() method. As soon as we hit the end of the scope, the input parameter no longer lives, and this “Hello” is removed from the heap.
Additionally, Rust’s String object does not implement the Copy trait, which means that it cannot automatically be copied when passing it in as a reference. This is different from basic types like integers or booleans, which can be copied easily.
### Sooooo, how do we fix this?
We could do a couple of things here.
  * We could clone the “Hello” (a) value. We get another instance of “Hello” (b) on the heap, which is only alive during scope of some_other_function making the input parameter the owner of that reference. var_b will stay the owner of it’s own copy (a) and a will be alive during the 3rd line where the output get’s printed. However, this is expensive, and not necessary.

We could pass back the ownership of “Hello” to var_b. We don’t have 2 copies on the heap, and the item will live long enough as the ownership is moved back and forth. Note that we’re modifying var_b and thus it should be marked as mutable.
It is good to mention that in rust, everything is immutable by default.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871868c2738334c2979905_carbon%20\(23\).png)
### Borrowing!
Although the examples above work, they are not recommended as they are not idiomatic Rust. Instead, Rust has a much better mechanism for dealing with allocated memory that is used by other variables and scopes. This is done using the borrowing mechanism in Rust. A borrowed value is indicated by using the & sign.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871887deeeccbf141f0aea_carbon%20\(24\).png)
In this case, the input temporary borrows the allocated memory from var_b and returns the ownership once it is done with it. Note that we don’t have to declare the var_b variable anymore as mutable.
This works as expected, but let’s try something more interesting. Let’s add a struct with some members and try borrowing the ownership while modifying some values.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648718be1eb143ca7b452086_carbon%20\(25\).png)
Although this may seem fine to most of you, the compiler won’t have any of it.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6487197eddeff466f25b58d0_carbon%20\(26\).png)
Remember, in Rust, everything is immutable by default, including borrowed values. However, you can get a mutable borrowed value by using the &mut syntax instead of &.
"In Rust, you can have as many immutable borrowed values as you’d like, but you can only have one mutable borrowed value at a time. This is a hard restriction that prevents us from running into various memory management issues and makes memory management more understandable."
"For simplicity’s sake, a struct was used instead of a String value. When using boxed allocations on the heap, we also have to work with lifetimes, making things even more complex. However, for now, let’s focus on borrowing."
We can fix the error by marking the input parameter as mutable using &mut.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648719d6fbf5fe0727ccc8e8_carbon%20\(27\).png)
### Some more examples
Consider the following code example:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/648719fc5a318e6276725432_carbon%20\(28\).png)
When attempting to compile the code, the Rust compiler is able to detect that memory is being released prematurely. It will issue a compile-time error, preventing us from running into issues at runtime. This is a powerful feature of Rust’s ownership system, as it helps to catch potential bugs before they can cause problems.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871a2242177231041af08f_carbon%20\(29\).png)
### Lifetimes
Another great example of the borrow checker in action is how it handles lifetimes
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871a50cce85e88959ccf71_carbon%20\(30\).png)
Although this code might appear normal, it will encounter compilation issues.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871a7e618ad3f15b12dd9e_carbon%20\(31\).png)
This function’s return type contains a borrowed value, but the signature does not indicate whether it is borrowed from x or y.
The reason is that x and y could have different lifetimes. The longest function doesn’t know about the lifetimes, and we need to know which lifetime to return. The compiler already told us how to fix this.
We will add the lifetime annotations to our method, as the compiler suggested.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871adcab23e7034983ad73_carbon%20\(32\).png)
What we are now specifying is a relationship between a, b and the return value. This means that the lifetime of the return value is the same as the shortest lifetime of the arguments. So if x has a smaller lifetime than y, then the lifetime of the return value is the same as x. Conversely, if the lifetime of y is smaller than x, the lifetime of the returned value is the same as y.
Going back to our main function, we can see that we print out the longest value at the end. The borrow checker will validate if the shortest lifetime is still valid.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871af9a4e43a6a15aea74d_carbon%20\(33\).png)
But lets say I want to do something different, let’s say like this:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871b2c93d22a50715315b5_carbon%20\(34\).png)
Although string1 has a longer lifetime than string2, when we print out the longest value, the lifetime of string2 is still valid, and our program can compile and execute without any issues.
However, if we were to do the following:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871b549ff9c75880116ec6_carbon%20\(35\).png)
The compiler will throw an error, indicating that the lifetime of the returned value is not guaranteed to be long enough when calling the println! macro.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/64871b799ff9c75880119a1c_carbon%20\(36\).png)
### Fighting the borrow checker
As you may have noticed, working with lifetimes and borrowing can be challenging in Rust. However, if you understand these concepts well, you will be able to write safe and efficient code. Even experienced developers can sometimes find it frustrating to work with the borrow checker, which has led to the creation of the meme “Fighting the borrow checker”.
### Conclusion
In conclusion, Rust’s borrow checker is a powerful tool for ensuring memory safety in Rust programs, but it can also be challenging to work with. However, with practice and a good understanding of lifetimes, developers can become proficient in writing Rust code that is not only safe, but also performant.

# Single Open SwipeView in Collection - Xamarin
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/60216cc46ff0da43bfdb7e68_swipeview_header.jpg)
## Here you will find the best solution for a SwipeView on a page.
In a project I’m working on, there was a specific request for having a collection of SwipeViews on a page, where it is only possible to have a single SwipeView swiped open. Since I wasn’t able to find a proper solution for that on the web (only a request, for example [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62874278/how-can-i-make-xamarin-forms-close-open-swiped-views), I decided to write a short post about my solution. The example repo you can find [here](https://github.com/rickdijk/SwipeViewCollectionExample/tree/main/SwipeViewCollectionExample/SingleSwipeCollectionExample).
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/602172acd993b53b0113bd74_SwipeViewCollectionExample.gif)
‍
In the last few months, Xamarin HQ has been working on stabilizing the SwipeView. As David Ortinau announced in his latest [blogpost](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-5-preview), Xamarin Forms 5.0 promises a lot of bug resolves and hopefully so a stable version of this control.
In the current stable version of Xamarin Forms, this control is still in preview and developers need to set the Experimental Flags for the SwipeView in the native projects, as described in the [documentation for the SwipeView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/swipeview).
For this project, I used a simple MVVM setup, so we need at least a Model, a View and a ViewModel to work with.
I will only use SwipeViews that open up on the right side, but you can implement this solution in every way you like for the SwipeView. I would say the possibilities are countless…
### Model
First thing I set up was the model, in this case a Person class with two properties. The IsOpen property is necessary to bind to the custom SwipeView I will explain later. I implemented the INotifyPropertyChanged interface to be able to notify the view about the IsOpen property updates.

{  
public string Name { get; set; }

public bool IsOpen  
{

set  
{

{  
_isOpen = value;

}  
}  
}

{  
PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));  
}

‍
### ViewModel
Simply create a list of Persons as a source for the CollectionView. The DeleteCommand handles the SwipeView Delete button that shows up when swiping the item to the left. The OpenItemChangedCommand sets the IsOpen property of any other Person item, that is not the last swiped Person item, to false.
OnPropertyChanged() is needed to update the page when an item is deleted from the list.

### Custom SwipeView
In order to get the solution working, we need to extend the existing SwipeView with some properties of our own. In the official documentation for SwipeView, I have already seen a bindable property IsOpen, but in the current stable Xamarin version, you’re not yet able to use it. In this case I created a bindable IsOpen property that will be bound to the IsOpen property in the Person model. When that property changes, the Command will be executed. Also make sure to set the BindingMode to TwoWay, since we need to be able to update both the View and the ViewModel in both ways.
The SwipeView gives us the ability to subscribe to the SwipeEnded event. With the SwipeEndedEventArgs we’re able to check if the SwipeView is open when the swipe gesture has ended. This is the key of success to this implementation: if the SwipeView is open, the IsOpen property will be updated. This will update the IsOpen property for the swiped Person item AND will execute the command to make sure all other Person items in the list will have the IsOpen property set to false.

### CollectionView
Last but not least, we need to create the page with the CollectionView. I used relative binding to be able to bind to the ViewModel from a DataTemplate. The model itself is bound as a CommandParameter to be able to update or delete the model from the list. Make sure to bind the Person.IsOpen property to the CustomSwipeView.IsOpen property.

# Starting a new job during the lockdown

## The experiences of our latest colleague who started working at Baseflow during the Covid lockdown
Somewhere halfway through 2020, I decided to take a new step in my career. Not that I needed a change of scenery as I worked from home since March that year, but I got offered an interesting opportunity at Baseflow. So after a few days of consideration, I jumped on the new job train. As I’ve worked remotely from home within a team for over half a year already, I thought this would be an easy switch. Just grab a new set of hardware and keep on going with the daily routine. I was so wrong. 
The first working day has been one of the few days I’ve been to the office. I got to meet the few people left there as the rest worked from home and got a nice introduction to the company. To help get me started, Baseflow introduced me to the buddy program, where you have a buddy assigned who helps you with the ins and outs of the company. I got to learn a lot from my buddy, and it made me realize how much information you miss without the small get-togethers or the quick conversations while grabbing a coffee.
I got introduced to Slack, the communication software used by Baseflow. Our daily contact moments are in the morning, and a few times a week we have a video call as a coffee break. After a few breaks, I started to realize that with every call, you get a bit of insight into how people live. Whether it’s a pet walking in the background or a piece of art hanging on the wall, it tells something about the person you’re talking to. A side of people you normally don’t see in the office.
In the last few months, I got back to my routine of working in a team. The digital stand-ups, the video calls, the online drinks, everything feels normal again. I’ve managed to get to know everyone who works at Baseflow and the company even sends several presents to make us feel extra valued. Whether it’s a beer and meat-loaded package for Christmas, brownies to cheer you up, or a delicious box of Easter egg chocolates, I’ve enjoyed them all.
It’s been a full year now since I’ve started working from home and even though the convenience of having no travel time does make it easier, I’m looking forward to going back to the office again. It’s the small moments I miss in the office, the social interactions, and enjoying a few drinks on a Friday afternoon with colleagues. I cannot wait until we can enjoy these things once more.

# The power of a People-First culture
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63ed4953e85c74ed2fcf1a09_chang-duong-Sj0iMtq_Z4w-unsplash%20\(1\).jpg)
## How investing time in your people delivers value
### The power of a People-First culture
As the workplace continues to change, it becomes increasingly crucial for businesses to ensure their culture reflects an attitude of prioritizing people first. A people-first approach in your culture can affect everything from employee performance and retention to customer satisfaction. In this blog I want to discuss why a people-first culture is essential for companies looking ahead toward success and sustainability in the digital age.
### Defining a people-first culture
Companies with a people-first culture understand that their most valuable asset is their people and they prioritize employee satisfaction over profits. A people-first culture encourages a healthy work-life balance, straightforward and honest feedback between managers and employees, open communication, and teamwork. Organizations with this culture evolve through greater efficiency, loyalty, success, and fulfillment. All of these things increase employee engagement, which is directly correlated to increasing overall company productivity.
It's no wonder that such cultures have become popular in recent years. And investing in your team's growth will help you better accomplish your goals as an organization.

### The benefits
A people-first culture can make all the difference in a team's ability to collaborate and innovate effectively. When you prioritize the well-being of your employees over other aspects of the workplace and keep people feeling respected and appreciated, you create a supportive environment where the people feel comfortable enough to contributing ideas and suggestions. This leads to happier workers who feel fulfilled within their roles, meaning improved morale, higher productivity, and better results. Additionally, when people feel valued by their employers, they are more likely to build deep relationships with colleagues. This benefits them personally and creates a more connected work atmosphere which contributes to creative thinking. By establishing that 'people-first' attitude in the workplace, you can open up doors for successful team-building experiences that benefit everybody involved.
### How to start
Creating a people-first culture in the workplace can be challenging, but it's well worth it. Start by encouraging everyone to treat each other respectfully, regardless of position and job title. Open lines of communication between employees and management should be established and increased – that way, all voices can be heard equally. Additionally, strive for a clear understanding of what people are working towards: develop team values and ensure everyone understands the shared vision. Encourage collaboration instead of competition; when everyone is willing to learn from each other, a culture centered around growth will emerge naturally. Finally, reward people for their achievements and contributions so they feel valued – this goes a long way in promoting loyalty and unity among your team. 
A people-first culture is the cornerstone of any successful business - this much is certain. Ultimately, it boils down to building credibility throughout your organization and placing people at the forefront of your decision-making process. So, while financial objectives are essential, they should never trump interpersonal relationships. When we prioritize our workers' ability to collaborate and get along with one another, only then do we create a space where creativity thrives and productivity soars. With these tips in mind, you can start to build an inclusive environment that celebrates team achievements instead of individual ones, which will inevitably lead to success in the long run.

# The Search for Searchable Encryption
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6322d6704c07bd7cc8dc1ef7_christina-wocintechchat-com-fch6vkbouCc-unsplash.jpg)
## Time for a technical blog involving… encryption!
That’s right: no Flutter or Xamarin, but a topic that can be just as interesting. Before I started working at Baseflow, I graduated in Cyber Security. My research focused on the topic of searchable encryption. Allow me to take you on a journey through the wonderful world of privacy, information leakage and hashing algorithms.
### **The problem**
Nowadays, we store loads of data; meeting notes, pet pictures, and all seasons of Mr. Robot. We typically store this data in the cloud, so it is always accessible to us. Also, keeping the data online means we do not have to buy the newest hard drive to personally store all of our data. It does not sit well for most people to trust big companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple with their personal data. And while I do not believe big tech companies to be inherently evil, I also do not think they view their user’s privacy as their primary concern.

‍
What can we do to prevent these companies from accessing our data while still using their services? Or to turn the question around, what can a service provider do to respect and guarantee a customer’s privacy? Encryption! Users encrypt the data that they share with the service provider. Then, when they retrieve the data, they can decrypt it themselves, and everything is fine. Right? Well, not really. See, the problem is that while this approach works from a data security perspective, by encrypting all data, there is no way to find out which data you want to retrieve from the cloud in the first place. For example, if I want to find an important email that Harry sent me, I go to my Gmail and type in ‘Harry’. As Google can read my emails, it can show me all relevant mail. However, if I were to encrypt all my emails, Google would have no idea what to show me! Google could send all the emails to me, and I could decrypt them all to find out which emails are relevant, but that kind of defeats the purpose of storing data in the cloud.
### **The solution**
So then, what is the solution? Searchable encryption! Searchable encryption schemes are designed to provide both data privacy and allow for search queries. These schemes exist in all sorts of forms and are typically achieved by using clever mathematical properties.
Some schemes are fast and provide a basic search operation, where one can search for a single word. Other methods allow more detailed searches, such as ‘wildcard queries’. The wildcard query ‘**l*g** ’ would match documents containing the words ‘lag’, ‘leg’, and ‘log’ for example. Another aspect that differs per scheme is its security. Searchable encryption schemes almost always leak some amount of data. This can be the user's search query or the number of words present in a document. Restricting the leakage usually comes with efficiency penalties. Typically, designers of searchable encryption schemes need to carefully balance the three properties, taking into account the environment the scheme will be used in.

‍
### **Constructing a simple scheme**
If you are still reading at this point, kudos to you for sticking with me! Let’s dive a bit deeper and look at how a basic scheme operates. We will construct a simple scheme that leaks tons of information to an outside observer. Nonetheless, it will show the basic structure of most modern schemes.
### Data format
First of all, most schemes consider data in a document id-keyword pair format. This means that any document, email or other data types we want to store are represented as multiple pairs consisting of its id and one keyword each.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6322d3bf8227691b85a99119_Afb3.png)
‍
Say we have a grocery list that we want to store. We give the list a number and consider every item on the list as a keyword. We then send the pairs _1-Hagelslag_ , _1-Chickpeas_ etc. to the server individually.
The server stores these pairs in what we call an index. An index can take many different shapes depending on the scheme, but in its simplest form, it is just a list of all id-keyword pairs.
### Algorithms
Most modern schemes consist of three pairs of algorithms.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6322d3e3e4bf88556941347b_Afb4.png)
‍
 _AddToken_ is used by the client to generate a token from an id-keyword pair and send it to the server. _Add_ is then used by the server to use this token to update its index.
_DeleteToken_ and _Delete_ work in the same way to remove pairs from the index.
_SearchToken_ is used by the client to instantiate a token based on a search query. The _Search_ algorithm is used by the server to check which ids match based on the search token. These ids are then used to determine which files must be returned to the client. The implementations of these algorithms differ per scheme and often get quite complicated. To give you a basic idea, let us create a simple scheme based on a hashing function.
### The scheme
The _AddToken_ algorithm will simply take the id-keyword pair and hash the keyword before sending the pair to the server. The _Add_ algorithm will add the pair directly to the index, which is a list in this scheme.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6322d4918b6f12a1b57d4931_Afb56.png)
‍
The _SearchToken_ algorithm hashes a single-keyword-query before sending it to the server.
The _Search_ algorithm simply checks the index for matching hashes. Every matching hash corresponds to an id of a matching document.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6322d4acaba663787ed5a47a_Afb78.png)
‍
Let’s take a look at what this scheme achieves, and what it doesn’t.
First of all, the scheme works. Yay! We can update and search data (I’ll leave deletion as an exercise for you!). Unfortunately, as you may have noticed already, we are only able to search for a single keyword at a time. With this scheme, we cannot search for documents containing multiple keywords or do fancy queries such as a wildcard search.
Let’s now direct our attention to security, since that is what started this whole quest. The good news: assuming we use a secure hashing function, both the content of the data and the client’s search query contents are hidden. The server never gets to see the actual keywords. However, we do reveal when we add or search the same keyword multiple times, as the hashes would be identical. An observer could see when we upload documents with the same keywords and deduce private information using clever analytical techniques. Additionally, the scheme leaks additional information such as the number of keywords in a document and metadata such as when we remove a specific document.
### **Closing words**
Together, we dived into the world of searchable encryption and designed a simple scheme. In my research, I designed a system to create wildcard-supporting schemes with additional security guarantees. Unfortunately, there is no blog post long enough for me to explain all intrinsics. I hope to have piqued your interest in the fascinating world that is searchable encryption.

# Unraveling Story Point Estimation Techniques
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/649aa16c27c8dad6db5aff8c_IMGP5551-_2_%20\(3\).webp)
## This blog will explain the concept of story points, and agile story pointing best practices.
Agile estimation techniques are crucial in software development, providing value not only for planning but also for communication, coordination, and learning. At the core of these techniques is a concept known as 'story points'. So, what is a story point in agile, and what should be taken into account when estimating these?
### **Understanding the Basics**
The story point definition is one of the fundamentals of agile methodology. Story points are a measure of effort required to implement a user story, an element of work that has a particular value to a user. They represent the overall difficulty of a task, taking into consideration complexity, risk, and uncertainty. Thus, the values are determined based on these three elements.
It is important to highlight that story points are not directly associated with time. A common misunderstanding is to equate a story point with a specific number of man-hours. However, story points encapsulate more than just the time required. The complexity, amount of work, and the uncertainty are all considered while estimating story points. Therefore, what do story points represent? Essentially, they provide an overall perspective on the difficulty level of a user story.
### **Story Point Estimation Agile: The Why and the How**
Agile estimation aids in understanding how much work the team can handle in a single sprint. This technique is known as 'sprint pointing' or 'scrum pointing' in the scrum point system. It enables teams to estimate user stories, contributing to effective project management.
So, how to assign story points? It's important to remember that the process of pointing stories is relative. This means that the estimation techniques are used to compare the effort, complexity, and uncertainty of one user story to another. The most common method to assign points is through the Fibonacci-like format where the numbers increase progressively, providing room for uncertainty and complexity.
### **What should be taken into account when estimating story points?**
#### **1. Use a Consistent Scale**
Consistency is key. Teams often use the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …) as their scale. The logic behind this is that as the size of a story grows, the amount of uncertainty (and thus risk) increases.
#### **2. Estimation Points Should Be a Team Effort**
The process should be collective. Every team member's perspective is crucial in the estimatation process, considering their experience, skills, and understanding of the requirements.
#### **3. Reevaluate Regularly**
Values aren't set in stone. As the team evolves, and as more information is acquired, it's crucial to regularly reevaluate estimates, making necessary adjustments.
#### **4. Avoid Directly Equating with Time**
As mentioned, story points encapsulate more than just time. They represent a holistic view of the effort required to complete a story.
### **What is the Best Definition of Story Points?**
In essence, they are a unit of measure that expresses the overall effort involved in developing a user story. This effort includes not just the amount of work, but also the complexity of the task, and the inherent risk or uncertainty associated with it.
### **A Final Word on Agile Story Points Estimation**
To sum it all up, story points are an integral part of agile project management, aiding in planning, estimating, and managing work. Remember that they are not about defining how long a task will take, but instead providing a relative measure of effort and complexity.
The process of estimating, also known as pointing stories, involves using a consistent scale, engaging the whole team in estimation, reevaluating estimates regularly, and avoiding a direct equation with time.
Finally, what's important to remember is that these techniques are tools to assist you, and not rules to be rigidly followed. The main goal of using agile estimation techniques is to support your team in delivering value effectively and efficiently.
We hope this deep dive into agile story point estimation, from story point definition to best practices, helps you enhance your approach to user story estimation, and contributes to more effective and enjoyable project journeys.

# Want to build 2D games? Now more accessible than ever with Flutter Flame.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63bbd060c6b9efaab5a774d0_pandhuya-niking-rl6aomPDKl8-unsplash.jpg)
## Anyone who has wondered about creating a 2D game should learn about Flame. Game development has not been so easy until now! Keep reading to discover the new world of 2D games that Flutter and Flame offer you!
### What is Flutter anyways?
Let's start by explaining what [Flutter](https://www.baseflow.com/technology/flutter) is - created by Google; it is an[ open-source](https://www.baseflow.com/technology) framework used to develop applications for multiple platforms like Mobile, Desktop, Web, etc., from a single code base. Flutter is extremely developer-friendly, as it offers speed in performance and accessibility through plenty of documentation and cuts down on developing time without compromising on UI or any other aspect.
### You've mentioned Flame... what is Flame?
With all of the above being said, let's explore what Flame is. Flame is a modular game engine that allows anyone who wants to create a 2D game with a complete set of tools! Flame is extremely powerful since it uses the Flutter infrastructure. Still, it also manages to simplify the developing process by tons. It has created another direction in which Flutter developers can go in. Flame is your best friend, from simple, catchy games to more advanced ones!
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63bbd1f41e37ba7d817a8423_FlutFlame.png)
### Why should we use Flame?
You might be wondering - it sounds all so nice, but why use Flame over an engine like Unity or Unreal Engine?
Well, it's a simple answer. No matter how much experience you have or don't even have, Flame is beginner-friendly! Since it is built on Flutter, it is naturally quite understandable and fast. You can still go out and create some pretty advanced games with it! It's all in your hands. 
Flame provides not only the accessibility of developing a 2D game but also several packages for adding audio and integrating SVG. If we compare it to Unity, Flame is far from that level of game engines.
Nevertheless, the learning curve is not so steep, even if you have little experience with Flutter or programming. It's possible to start from the very beginning, and it's possible to dive right in and create advanced games immediately! Another thing worth mentioning, just like Flutter, Flame provides you with enough tools to develop fast without cutting down on essential aspects like Game Designs! 
### What do we need to get started?
Starting with Flame, it's pretty simple. All you need is a Flutter-compatible IDE like VS Code or Android Studio, a game idea you like and desire to create! Furthermore, you will need to set up a project. All you have to do is follow the Installation and Getting started guidelines on their official [website](https://docs.flame-engine.org/1.5.0/).
Yes, it's that simple.
### How to start learning Flame and create your very own game?
Let's review some of the basics you might find helpful when starting a game!
Whenever you begin a new Flutter project, you will find that in the folder _lib_ , you have a file _main.dart_ that you use to run your project. In the same folder, you should create all the other files containing game components and only run one in the _main.dart_ file.
This way, your game structure will be more precise. We can see what all of this means in practice now. 
Start by creating a file called _game.dart_ , for example. There you would be displaying all of your components. It should look something like this:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63bbcf0dc0213a27dc753ea8_game_class.png)
Now it might be pretty useful to create the component we wanted to use. This is the _Player_ component, and it's good if we create separate files for each one. Let's make the _player.dart_ file and see what it looks like:
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63bbceedd9906873dd3ab2ec_component_class.png)
The _@override_ functions we keep seeing ensure that they are always called at the start and don't need to be recalled. We can also notice that the component has a function you can explicitly call whenever you need it. 
Some more explanations - we can see that _Vector2_ takes two values - the X-axis and Y-axis, respectively. With Flame, the 0's of the axis meet at the top left corner of the screen. Now you can choose your positions and sizes! Try it out differently and see what you prefer for your game.
Another thing worth mentioning, your images should already be in the folder _assets_ and included in the _pubspec.yaml_ so you can access them.
At this point, we have already created a component and called it in the base of the game. The only thing that is left is to run the game! This is as simple as that: 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63bbcf397fceb0e18666cd0a_run_game.png)
Now that you can run your game with a component, it is time for you to start adding more components and explore some functionalities! Everything you would want to know how to do, you can find in the [Flame documentation](https://docs.flame-engine.org/1.5.0/flame/flame.html). 
To wrap up, every developer has once wondered about creating a catchy game. Game development is not that easy, given that one of the most famous engines is Unity, which is quite frankly tricky for beginners. However, with the game engine Flame, creating your own game is now more accessible than ever! All it takes is to start a Flutter project and add some components! The documentation is excellent, and the engine is easily accessible. There is no reason anymore not to try it out! Remember to enjoy creating and exploring with Flame!

# What are super apps and why are they becoming more popular?
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/635645f66e708a010d704be3_IMGP5583.webp)
## What if a single app could do everything you want? 
### **What are super apps?**
As our lives become increasingly digital, we increasingly rely on mobile apps to get things done. And while there are many different types of apps available, from social media to shopping apps, one type that is becoming increasingly popular is the super app.
A super app is a mobile app that offers a wide range of services within a single platform. They are becoming increasingly popular because they provide users with a convenient way to access various services from one place. Super apps also tend to be more engaging and interactive than traditional apps, making them more enjoyable. In addition, super apps often provide users with rewards and discounts, which makes them even more appealing.
Some popular super apps include WeChat, Alipay, and Meituan. These apps have transformed how Chinese people live and work by providing them with a one-stop shop for all their needs. For example, WeChat allows users to communicate with friends and family, pay bills, book appointments, and much more. Similarly, Alipay is a hugely popular payment app that offers various other services, such as discounts and deals on popular products and brands.

‍
### **How did super apps come about and why are they becoming more popular?**
Super apps first became popular in Asia, where they quickly gained a large following among users looking for a more convenient way to access various services from one place. In recent years, super apps have also begun to gain popularity in other parts of the world as more and more people are looking for ways to simplify their lives and get more done each day.
### **How can you tell if an app is a super app and how can you start using them in your own life?**
There are a few ways to tell if an app is a super app:
  1. Check if the app offers a wide range of services within a single platform.
  2. Look for apps developed by large tech companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, or WeChat that want to combine all their services into one app.
  3. Look for apps that tend to be more engaging and interactive than traditional apps.


If you want to start using super apps in your own life, the best place to start is by downloading a few of the most popular ones and seeing which ones you like the best. Once you've found a few you want, explore all the different features they offer and start using them to simplify your life.

‍
### **Are there any drawbacks to using super apps or are they perfect for everyone who wants to simplify their lives and get more done each day?**
There are a few potential drawbacks to using super apps:
  1. Some people may find them too convenient and may start relying too much on them. This can lead to users becoming less productive and may even cause them to miss important events or deadlines. As most super apps tend to be incredibly engaging and addictive, users may find themselves in a situation wherein their screen time grows exponentially.
  2. Super apps can sometimes be buggy or slow, frustrating users. Because super apps tend to consist of many different components that all work and communicate together, the data streams within these apps can become cluttered and significantly slow down your device.
  3. As super apps tend to market themselves as a 'one-stop shop,' users might be dissatisfied as the app may not offer all the features that users want or offer many useless features that users do not want. 


Overall, super apps are an excellent way for people to simplify their lives and potentially get more done daily. A super app may be suitable if you're looking for a convenient way to access various services. Just be sure to download a few different ones and explore all the features they offer before deciding which one is the best fit for you.

# What Is a Common Misconception About Agile and DevOps?
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/644a339dc9e2e868a59237b0_6447c3b971fb28a3b0a06b9a_IMGP5583.webp)
## Agile and DevOps are two buzzwords that have been used quite extensively these days in the software development world.
Many believe that these methodologies are a sure-shot ticket to success, while others believe that they are not worth the hype. Regardless of which side of the fence you stand on, there is a common misconception regarding Agile and DevOps that needs to be addressed. In this article, we will take a deep dive into this misconception and dispel it once and for all.
### Understanding Agile and DevOps
Before we dive into the misconception surrounding Agile and DevOps, let us first understand what these two methodologies are.
#### Defining Agile Methodology
Agile methodology is a software development approach that focuses on delivering high-quality software in small, incremental stages. It emphasizes collaboration, communication, and rapid feedback throughout the development process. Agile methodology comprises of various frameworks, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming, which help implement the Agile approach.
One of the key benefits of Agile methodology is that it allows for greater flexibility in the development process. By breaking down the development process into smaller stages, development teams can quickly adapt to changing requirements and make adjustments as necessary. This helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the end-users.
Another advantage of Agile methodology is that it encourages collaboration and communication between team members. This helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards a common goal. It also allows for rapid feedback, which can help to identify and resolve issues early in the development process.
#### Defining DevOps
DevOps is an extension of Agile methodology that focuses on collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. Its primary goal is to automate the entire software development lifecycle, right from code development to application deployment. DevOps aims to break down the silos between development and operations teams and ensure that they work together with a common goal of delivering high-quality software faster.
One of the key benefits of DevOps is that it helps to streamline the software development process. By automating many of the tasks involved in software development, such as testing and deployment, DevOps can help to reduce the time and effort required to deliver high-quality software. This can help to improve the overall efficiency of the development process and reduce the likelihood of errors or defects.
Another advantage of DevOps is that it encourages collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. By working together towards a common goal, these teams can ensure that the software they produce meets the needs of both the end-users and the operations team responsible for maintaining and deploying the software.
In conclusion, Agile and DevOps are two methodologies that can help organizations to deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently. By emphasizing collaboration, communication, and automation, these methodologies can help to break down silos between teams and ensure that everyone is working towards a common goal. Whether you are developing software for a small startup or a large enterprise, Agile and DevOps can help you to stay competitive and deliver value to your customers.
### Common Misconceptions About Agile and DevOps
Now that we have a basic understanding of Agile and DevOps let's take a look at some of the common misconceptions regarding these methodologies.
#### Misconception 1: Agile and DevOps Are the Same Thing
Many people believe that Agile and DevOps are the same thing, and there is no difference between the two. However, this is not true. While Agile focuses on delivering high-quality software in small, incremental stages, DevOps focuses on collaboration and communication between development and operations teams through automation. Agile and DevOps are two different methodologies that work in tandem to deliver high-quality software.
For instance, Agile focuses on delivering a working product in small increments, while DevOps focuses on automating the delivery process to ensure that the product is delivered quickly and efficiently. The two methodologies complement each other, but they are not the same.
#### Misconception 2: Agile and DevOps Are Only for Software Development
Another common misconception is that Agile and DevOps are only applicable to software development. However, this is not true. Agile and DevOps principles can be applied to any industry that involves a software development lifecycle, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and finance. Any organization that wants to deliver high-quality software or products at a faster pace can benefit from Agile and DevOps methodologies.
For example, Agile and DevOps can help manufacturing companies to streamline their production processes and improve the quality of their products. Healthcare organizations can use Agile and DevOps to develop and deploy new healthcare applications quickly and efficiently. Similarly, financial institutions can use Agile and DevOps to develop and deploy new financial products and services.
#### Misconception 3: Implementing Agile or DevOps Guarantees Success
Many organizations implement Agile or DevOps with the belief that it guarantees success. However, this is not entirely true. Implementing Agile or DevOps is no guarantee of success. For instance, if the organization lacks the requisite skills, infrastructure, or culture, the implementation may fail. Agile and DevOps are merely tools that help organizations achieve their goals. The success of these methodologies primarily depends on how the organization implements them.
Therefore, organizations need to invest in training their employees, building the necessary infrastructure, and creating a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement to ensure the success of Agile and DevOps implementations.
#### Misconception 4: Agile and DevOps Eliminate the Need for Management
Another popular misconception is that Agile and DevOps eliminate the need for management. However, this is far from the truth. Agile and DevOps methodologies require a different kind of management that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and teamwork. The management approach may differ from traditional command-and-control management, but it is still essential. Managers need to adapt to the Agile and DevOps approach to ensure that the organization achieves its goals.
For example, Agile and DevOps require managers to act as facilitators rather than commanders. They need to foster a culture of collaboration and encourage open communication between teams. Managers also need to provide the necessary resources and support to help teams achieve their goals.
In conclusion, Agile and DevOps are powerful methodologies that can help organizations deliver high-quality software and products quickly and efficiently. However, to achieve success, organizations need to understand the nuances of these methodologies and implement them correctly. By dispelling these common misconceptions, organizations can better leverage Agile and DevOps to achieve their goals.
### The Benefits of Agile and DevOps
Despite these common misconceptions, Agile and DevOps do offer several benefits, which we will explore. In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the advantages of Agile and DevOps methodologies and how they can help organizations deliver high-quality software faster.
#### Improved Collaboration and Communication
Agile and DevOps emphasize collaboration and communication between different teams, such as development, operations, and testing. Such collaboration helps remove silos and ensures that everyone works towards a common goal of delivering high-quality software faster. By breaking down the barriers between teams, Agile and DevOps create a culture of collaboration and communication that fosters innovation and creativity.
Teams that work together effectively can share knowledge and expertise, which can lead to better decision-making and problem-solving. When teams are aligned and working towards a common goal, they can deliver software faster and with fewer errors. This, in turn, leads to higher customer satisfaction and better business outcomes.
#### Faster Delivery and Continuous Improvement
Agile and DevOps are designed to deliver high-quality software at a faster pace than traditional software development approaches. They achieve this by breaking down the development process into smaller incremental stages, ensuring that the software is delivered faster, and continuous improvements can be made throughout the development process.
Continuous improvement is a core principle of Agile and DevOps methodologies. By continuously testing and improving the software, teams can identify and address issues early in the development process. This reduces the risk of defects and delays, ensuring that the software is delivered on time and within budget.
#### Higher Quality and Customer Satisfaction
Agile and DevOps methodologies focus on delivering high-quality software by ensuring that the software is tested thoroughly throughout the development process. This emphasis on quality results in higher customer satisfaction, as the end-users receive a product that meets or exceeds their expectations.
By delivering software faster and with fewer errors, Agile and DevOps methodologies can help organizations stay ahead of the competition. This can lead to increased customer loyalty and improved business outcomes. In addition, by involving customers in the development process, Agile and DevOps methodologies ensure that the software meets their needs and expectations.
In conclusion, Agile and DevOps methodologies offer many benefits, including improved collaboration and communication, faster delivery, continuous improvement, higher quality, and customer satisfaction. By adopting these methodologies, organizations can deliver high-quality software faster, stay ahead of the competition, and achieve better business outcomes.
### How to Correctly Implement Agile and DevOps
Now that we have explored the common misconceptions and benefits of Agile and DevOps let's take a look at how to correctly implement these methodologies.
#### Assessing Your Organization's Needs
The first step in implementing Agile and DevOps is to assess your organization's needs. The assessment should primarily focus on the organization's culture, skills, and infrastructure. The assessment should identify any gaps that need to be filled before implementing Agile and DevOps methodologies.
#### Building a Cross-Functional Team
The next step is to build a cross-functional team that comprises of members from different teams, such as development, operations, and testing. This team will be responsible for implementing the Agile and DevOps methodologies and ensuring that the software is delivered at a faster pace.
#### Establishing a Continuous Feedback Loop
Agile and DevOps methodologies require a continuous feedback loop, where the team members communicate regularly on the progress of the project, any issues that need to be addressed, and any improvements that can be made. Establishing such a feedback loop ensures that everyone is on the same page and helps identify any issues early on, which can be resolved before they escalate.
#### Embracing a Culture of Learning and Adaptation
Agile and DevOps methodologies require a culture of learning and adaptation. The team members should be willing to learn new things, adapt to changes, and continuously improve throughout the development process. Embracing such a culture ensures that the organization is always evolving and improving its software development lifecycle.
### Conclusion
In conclusion, Agile and DevOps are two different methodologies that work in tandem to deliver high-quality software faster. However, there are several common misconceptions regarding these methodologies. These misconceptions can be dispelled by understanding the difference between Agile and DevOps, the benefits that they offer, and how to correctly implement them.

# What is a monolith and how does it bottleneck your application development?
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/635120dbac544297e1abc24a_IMGP5879.jpg)
## Monoliths and microservices differ much from each other, therefore a complex perspective is needed to understand both of them.
### **What is a monolith and how does it bottleneck your application development?**
A monolith is a software development term that refers to an application which is composed of a single and large codebase. As the size of the codebase grows, it becomes more difficult for developers to make changes to the code without impacting other parts of the codebase. This can lead to a number of problems, including longer development times, increased chances of errors, and difficulty reusing code. 
In addition, a monolithic codebase can be difficult to test and maintain. As a result, many developers are now moving towards a microservices approach, which allows for greater flexibility and modularity. While there are some advantages to a monolithic approach, the pain points can outweigh the benefits for many development teams.
### **What is a microservice and how does it differ from a monolith?**
A microservice is an application that consists of a set of small, independently deployable services. In a microservices architecture, each service is responsible for a small subset of isolated features, and it does it very well, without many dependencies to other features of the code base. Preferable as isolated as possible. Monoliths are usually deployed on a single server, while microservices can be deployed on a distributed system. Monoliths typically start small but grow as feature creep sets in and everything is developed within a single code base. With microservices you have a constant process of: I am going to develop something, where does it belong, how do I interface with the outside world, and where are the boundaries? Microservices are more scalable and easier to manage than monoliths but require a more complex perspective into microservice architecture because the boundaries per microservice are very strict.
### **How can you sustain innovation speed by converting a monolith into microservices?**
You might want to convert a monolithic software system into a microservices-based architecture for several reasons. By breaking up the monolith into more minor, independent services, you can increase the speed of innovation by making it easier to deploy new features and update existing ones. In addition, microservices can allow you to scale different parts of the system independently, improving overall efficiency. 
However, converting a monolith to microservices is not a simple task. You must carefully consider the dependencies between different system parts and design your services accordingly. Business logic might have become tangled over time, which will require you to 'untangle' dependent code. In addition, you will need to put in place adequate DevOps and monitoring infrastructure to support the microservices-based system. Done correctly, though, converting a monolith to microservices can help you sustain innovation speed while improving overall system performance.
### **The benefits of using microservices**
The use of microservices has become increasingly popular in recent years as businesses look for ways to improve the efficiency of their operations. Microservices are a software architecture that enables different application components to be developed and deployed independently. 
This has several benefits, including improved flexibility, reduced complexity, and shorter development cycles. In addition, microservices can be deployed on various platforms, allowing businesses to choose the most cost-effective solution for their needs. As microservices continue to grow, even more companies will likely begin to realize the many advantages this approach offers.
### **How to get started on converting your monolith to microservices**
If you're considering converting your monolithic application to microservices, you'll need to consider a few things. First, you'll need to identify which parts of your application can be broken down into individual services. Each service should be a self-contained unit responsible for a specific task or set of functions. Once you've identified the services you want to create, you'll need to design the communication interface between them. 
However, communication between microservices still have to be limited as the services still need to function independently. What often happens is that microservices are developed but still have too much dependency on one another, if there are too many dependencies, and one microservice goes down, the whole system goes down. Designing the communication interface involves defining the input and output for each service and the format of the data that will be exchanged. In addition, you'll need to implement the services themselves. This will involve writing the code for each service and deploying it to a server or servers. By following these steps, you can ensure that your transition to microservices goes smoothly.
### **Tips for maintaining the speed of innovation with microservices**
To maintain the pace of innovation, microservices need to be managed appropriately. Here are a few tips on how to do that:
1. Keep the services small and focused. This will help prevent them from becoming overloaded and bogged down.
2. Make sure the services are loosely coupled. This will allow them to be changed or updated without impacting other services.
3. Keep the services well-organized. This will help ensure that they can be easily maintained and updated.
4. Be sure to properly test the services before deploying them. This will help ensure that they are stable and free of errors.Unit and integration tests in a CD/CI lane can guarantee the quality of the service to a high degree. Because the functionality has been scoped, testing will be much easier.
5. Monitor the performance of the services constantly. This will help identify any potential problems so that they can be fixed quickly.
Following these tips can help ensure that your microservices remain fast and innovative.
### **Conclusion**
What is a monolith, and how can you sustain innovation speed by converting it to microservices? A monolith is an extensive software system that does everything in one go. This makes it difficult to change or update. On the other hand, Microservices are small, modular services that can be updated and revised quickly and easily. This makes them perfect for sustaining innovation speed. The benefits of using microservices are manifold: they improve communication and collaboration between teams, make testing and deploying changes easier, allow for more experimentation, and result in faster time-to-market. If you want to get started converting your monolith into microservices, our team at Baseflow can help!

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/6396e615a9308970075ce395_IMGP5547.webp)
## Have you ever wondered what happens behind the application you're looking at to make it work? That's where backend development comes in. In this blog we'll discuss the in's and out's of backend development.
### **What is backend development and why is it important?**
Backend development is a term used in the software development industry to describe the programming and coding behind the user interface. This includes all of the functionality that happens on the server side, such as database interactions, business logic, and routing. Backend developers are responsible for building the APIs and services that make up the backbone of web and mobile applications. In this blog post, we will discuss what backend development is and some of its key components!
### **What are some everyday backend development tasks?**
Backend developers are responsible for building and maintaining the technology needed to power the frontend of websites and applications. This includes creating and managing databases, setting up servers, building APIs, and more.
### **What are some common backend programming languages?**
When it comes to backend development, there are a variety of languages that programmers can select from. Each language has its own unique benefits and drawbacks depending on what kind of project you're working on. Here's a rundown of some popular backend programming languages used in web development today and the advantages they offer: 
[.NET](https://www.baseflow.com/technology/dotnet) is a powerful, reliable and versatile framework used in backend development for producing high-quality web applications. It has a vast library of components with which developers can easily extend their applications to accomplish almost any task. Moreover, .NET offers extensive support for various technologies like databases, languages, distributed computing, XML and many more with rapid prototyping capabilities. Thanks to its scalability and security measures, .NET provides small to large businesses the ability to create high performance applications showing robustness and flexibility. As such .NET makes a great option if you are looking for backend development solution to prepare an app that meets the specific requirements of your target users.
[Golang](https://go.dev/) (or Go) is a programming language that is quickly gaining popularity for its ease of use, scalability, and speed. It is most often used for backend development, as its great performance ensures that your web applications and services can handle large amounts of data efficiently. Additionally, the language’s popularity means it has many libraries and frameworks already in existence making code sharing and collaboration simpler. Golang also offers excellent error detection through its native debugging tools, meaning developers spend less time tracking down discrepancies. All these factors combined have made Golang a top choice for any development project's backend needs.
[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an object-oriented scripting language that allows developers to create scalable web applications quickly and easily. Python is comparatively easy to learn, making it a great choice for beginner developers. It also has a lot of libraries and frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid that make development easier. Furthermore, Python code is usually more concise than other languages, allowing for faster development times. However, since Python is an interpreted language it tends to run slower than compiled languages like Java or C++. 
[Java](https://dev.java/) is one of the most popular backend programming languages used today, typically employed to create large-scale applications and websites. It has been around since 1995 and is known for its flexibility, scalability and robustness. Java is an object-oriented language that allows developers to write code once and use it anywhere. Furthermore, since Java is a compiled language it runs faster than other scripting languages and can handle more complex development tasks. The main downside of using Java is that it requires more code compared to other languages such as Python or Ruby. 
[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) (Rails) is a web application framework written in Ruby that makes creating database-backed websites easier. It's popular for its speed, flexibility and scalability. Rails is ideal for rapid development because it provides a wide range of in-built features such as MVC structure, RESTful architecture and an active community. However, Ruby on Rails is not well suited to large projects due to the complexity of the codebase and its slower performance compared to other languages. 
[PHP](https://www.php.net/) is a general-purpose scripting language often used to create dynamic webpages. It has been around since 1994 and is one of the most widely used backend programming languages today. PHP code is easy to write, making it perfect for novice developers who are just getting started with web development. Additionally, PHP offers cross-platform compatibility and can be integrated with many different databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. On the downside, PHP is not as secure as other languages like Java or Python and can be vulnerable to malicious attacks. 
Ultimately, the right backend development language for your project will depend on the specific requirements of your application and what you are trying to achieve. Each language has its own unique advantages and drawbacks that must be taken into consideration before selecting a language for your project. If you're unsure which language is best suited for your needs, consulting a professional developer may be a wise choice. 
No matter what language you decide to use, it's important to remember that coding isn't something that should be rushed; taking time to research different languages thoroughly before making a decision will ensure you select the most appropriate
### **What is a database?**
Another essential aspect of backend development is database management. Database management involves creating and maintaining databases that are used by applications. This includes designing database schema, writing SQL queries, and optimizing database performance. Backend developers need to have a strong understanding of database management to build efficient and reliable applications.
A database is a collection of data that computers can access. Backend developers often use databases to store information such as user data, application data, and more. This data is often stored within a server. A server is a computer that stores websites or applications and makes them available to users on the internet. To view a website or use an application, a request is sent to the server, which then sends the desired information. Backend systems must be scalable to accommodate traffic or data volume growth without slowing down or crashing.
Developers have a range of databases to choose from, including relational (e.g. MySQL or Postgres) and non-relational (e.g. MongoDB).
### **What is an API and which different types of API’s exist?**
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that allow developers to build software applications with ease. These APIs provide developers the capability to access data and functionality from other applications, services or systems. 
There are different types of API's available in the market. These include web service APIs (such as REST and SOAP), library-based APIs (like cURL), operating system calls (like LINUX) and messaging-based APIs (like Pub/Sub). 
REST API is an application interface based on Representational State Transfer principles which provides a standard way for retrieving and manipulating data in modern web applications. The advantage of using REST API is that it allows developers to create complex applications quickly and efficiently. 
Remote API’s involve transferring data over a network connection, most commonly over the internet. They provide interfaces to the user, making it easier to access specific information or services. 
An API call is essentially a request of some kind which is sent from an external application to a server. The request is processed by an API interface program which then sends back an answer with relevant data or services based on the initial query. Remote API’s have become increasingly popular due to their convenience and ability to access multiple resources at once, while still providing excellent security levels against malicious intrusions.
API endpoints are URLs that provide access to the API's data, operations and other resources. They allow developers to interact with APIs by sending requests and receiving responses. Endpoints can be either public or private depending on the security requirements of an application. Public endpoints can be accessed without authentication while private endpoints require authentication before they can be used. 
Using APIs is a great way for software developers to create powerful applications quickly and easily. However, it is important to understand how these APIs work in order to ensure proper security protocols are followed at all times so as not to expose sensitive information or put users' privacy at risk. With the right knowledge and understanding, developers can create efficient applications that offer valuable services to users. 
API's have a number of advantages for software developers, including the ability to easily access data from other systems or applications, reduce development time by reusing existing code and services, improve performance by leveraging third-party API usage instead of building everything in-house and develop applications faster by focusing on core business logic. Additionally, API's can also provide scalability and flexibility as they allow developers to modify an application's functionality without having to completely rewrite it. 
Overall, API's are an invaluable tool for software developers as they greatly simplify the process of developing complex and powerful applications. By understanding how APIs work, what types are available and how to properly secure them, developers can create robust applications quickly and efficiently. 
### **What skills do I need for backend development?**
Becoming a backend developer is no small feat. Essential skills for this coding career path include working with databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL; knowledge of at least one scripting language such as PHP, Python or Ruby; and the ability to debug code. 
Developers also need to have a good understanding of server architecture and design, protocols such as the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), caching technologies, and an overall general knowledge of system administration. Moreover, engine designers should have strong problem-solving skills and be comfortable ensuring data security measures are up-to-date. Aspiring backend engineers should keep these qualifications in mind before they embark on this challenging journey.
Overall, backend development is a critical part of the software development process. We can build the robust and scalable applications we use today with backend developers. If you're interested in becoming a backend developer, brush up on your database management and API design skills!

### **What is the future of AI in software development?**
The future of AI in software development is an exciting prospect with the potential to revolutionize how applications are created and deployed. With their ability to analyze data constructively and make efficient decisions, they can eventually create autonomous bots able to perform tasks without human intervention. AI has already been used in many aspects of software development, including predictive analytics, bug detection, and debugging. As technology advances, many innovations have the potential to increase automation and minimize tedious manual coding practices, not only increasing speed but the precision of code too. Human supervision will always remain a crucial part of development; however, AI's contribution will supersede conventional methods for the foreseeable future.

# When Is the Right Time for Agile Teams to Make Room for Innovation?
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/644a31a2b165b633f33c5628_6447c29182c13f4858508b68_IMGP5555.webp)
## Agile methodologies are designed to encourage teams to respond quickly to changes and deliver high-quality work regularly.
However, this can sometimes stifle innovation as teams may become too focused on completing tasks and meeting deadlines. So, when is the right time for Agile teams to make room for innovation?
### Understanding the Importance of Innovation in Agile Teams
Innovation is critical for Agile teams to stay competitive and succeed in today's market. It is the process of generating new and creative solutions to problems, improving products or services, and finding new opportunities for growth. Innovation in Agile teams can result in greater efficiency, better quality, and increased customer satisfaction. It can also boost morale, engagement, and retention rates within the team.
Agile methodology is an approach to project management that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid iteration. It is designed to help teams respond quickly to changing requirements and deliver value to customers in a timely and efficient manner. Innovation plays an essential role in achieving this goal. By bringing fresh perspectives and creative solutions to the table, Agile teams can continuously improve their products, processes, and services in response to changing needs and market trends.
#### The role of innovation in Agile methodology
Innovation is a key component of Agile methodology. It allows teams to stay ahead of the curve and deliver value to customers in new and exciting ways. Agile teams are encouraged to experiment and try new things, which can lead to breakthroughs and game-changing ideas. By embracing innovation, Agile teams can create a culture of continuous improvement and stay competitive in a rapidly changing market.
Innovation can take many forms in Agile teams. It can involve developing new features, improving existing processes, or finding new ways to solve problems. Whatever the form, innovation is essential for Agile teams to stay relevant and deliver value to customers.
#### Balancing innovation with daily tasks and responsibilities
One of the challenges of innovation in Agile teams is finding the right balance between daily tasks and responsibilities and exploring new ideas. Agile teams need to prioritize innovation while still meeting deadlines and delivering quality work. This requires careful planning, effective communication, and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.
One way to balance innovation with daily tasks and responsibilities is to set aside dedicated time for innovation. This can involve scheduling regular brainstorming sessions or hackathons, where team members can focus on generating new ideas and experimenting with new technologies. By setting aside time for innovation, Agile teams can ensure that it remains a priority and doesn't get lost in the day-to-day tasks of project management.
Another way to balance innovation with daily tasks and responsibilities is to encourage a culture of experimentation and learning. Agile teams should be encouraged to try new things and learn from their mistakes. By embracing a culture of experimentation, teams can continuously improve their processes and products, while still meeting their daily responsibilities.
In conclusion, innovation is critical for Agile teams to stay competitive and succeed in today's market. By embracing innovation, Agile teams can continuously improve their products, processes, and services, while still meeting their daily responsibilities. Finding the right balance between innovation and daily tasks and responsibilities requires careful planning, effective communication, and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances. With the right approach, Agile teams can create a culture of continuous improvement and stay ahead of the curve.
### Identifying the Right Time for Innovation
Innovation is a critical component of Agile teams, as it helps them stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive in today's fast-paced business environment. However, it's equally important to identify the right time for innovation. Teams need to recognize when they are becoming stagnant and need to shake things up with fresh ideas and approaches.
One way to identify the right time for innovation is to recognize the signs of stagnation in Agile teams. These signs include decreased productivity and quality, a lack of enthusiasm and engagement in team members, no new ideas or progress in work, and repeating the same solutions to problems.
When teams notice these signs, it's time to make room for innovation. They need to step back and assess their current approach to work and determine what changes need to be made to drive progress and growth.
#### Recognizing the Signs of Stagnation in Agile Teams
  * **Decreased Productivity and Quality:** When teams are no longer producing high-quality work in a timely manner, it's a sign that something needs to change. Teams should look at their processes and determine where improvements can be made.
  * **Lack of Enthusiasm and Engagement in Team Members:** If team members are no longer excited about their work or engaged in the project, it's a sign that they need a new challenge. Innovation can provide that challenge and reignite their passion for the project.
  * **No New Ideas or Progress in Work:** When teams are no longer generating new ideas or making progress on their work, it's a sign that they need to shake things up. Innovation can provide a fresh perspective and new ideas to help move the project forward.
  * **Repeating the Same Solutions to Problems:** When teams are repeatedly using the same solutions to problems, it's a sign that they need to explore new approaches. Innovation can help teams find new and better solutions to their problems.


#### Assessing Team Capacity and Workload
Before embarking on an innovation project, teams need to be realistic about their capacity and workload. Innovation requires time, resources, and effort, and teams need to assess whether they have the bandwidth to take on the challenge.
Teams should consider their current workload and determine whether they can allocate the necessary time and resources to an innovation project. They should also consider the skills and expertise required for the project and determine whether they have the necessary talent on the team or if they need to bring in outside help.
#### Aligning Innovation Efforts with Business Goals
Agile teams need to ensure that their innovation efforts align with business goals and priorities. This helps to ensure that the team is working on projects that will have a positive impact on the organization and its customers.
Teams should work closely with stakeholders to determine the business goals and priorities and then align their innovation efforts accordingly. This helps to ensure that the team is working on projects that will drive business growth and success.
In conclusion, identifying the right time for innovation is crucial for the success of Agile teams. By recognizing the signs of stagnation, assessing team capacity and workload, and aligning innovation efforts with business goals, teams can drive progress and growth and remain competitive in today's fast-paced business environment.
### Creating a Culture of Innovation within Agile Teams
Creating a culture of innovation is essential for Agile teams to foster creativity, collaboration, and risk-taking. The following are some ways in which Agile teams can create a culture of innovation:
#### Encouraging open communication and idea sharing
Communication is vital in Agile teams, and it's essential to create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas and thoughts. Agile teams can encourage open communication by organizing regular meetings where team members can share their progress and ideas. These meetings can be structured or unstructured, and they can take place in person or online. Agile teams can also use collaboration tools such as Slack or Microsoft Teams to facilitate communication and idea sharing.
In addition to regular meetings, Agile teams can also organize brainstorming sessions where team members can come together to generate new ideas. These sessions can be facilitated by a team leader or an external facilitator and can involve team members from different departments or areas of expertise. Brainstorming sessions can be a great way to break down silos and encourage cross-functional collaboration.
#### Providing time and resources for innovation
Agile teams need to carve out time and allocate resources for innovation projects. This can involve setting aside designated time for brainstorming sessions or providing team members with the tools and technologies they need to explore new ideas. Agile teams can also allocate a portion of their budget to innovation projects, allowing team members to experiment with new approaches and technologies without worrying about the financial implications.
Agile teams can also encourage innovation by promoting a culture of experimentation. This can involve allowing team members to work on pet projects or encouraging them to take risks and try new things. By creating a safe space for experimentation, Agile teams can foster a culture of innovation and encourage team members to think outside the box.
#### Celebrating and rewarding innovative thinking
Celebrating and rewarding innovative thinking can help to reinforce a culture of innovation within Agile teams. Recognizing individuals or teams who come up with creative solutions or ideas can motivate others to think outside the box and take risks. Agile teams can celebrate innovation by highlighting successful projects or ideas at team meetings or company-wide events. They can also reward innovative thinking by offering bonuses or promotions to team members who come up with breakthrough ideas.
Another way to celebrate innovation is to create an innovation lab or center of excellence within the organization. This can be a physical or virtual space where team members can come together to experiment with new ideas and technologies. By creating a dedicated space for innovation, Agile teams can signal to team members that innovation is a priority and encourage them to think creatively.
In conclusion, creating a culture of innovation is essential for Agile teams to remain competitive and adapt to changing market conditions. By encouraging open communication and idea sharing, providing time and resources for innovation, and celebrating and rewarding innovative thinking, Agile teams can foster a culture of innovation and drive success.
### Implementing Innovation in Agile Processes
To successfully implement innovation in Agile processes, teams need to integrate innovation into their existing frameworks and adapt the Agile methodology accordingly. The following are some ways in which Agile teams can implement innovation:
#### Integrating innovation into Agile ceremonies
Agile ceremonies, such as sprint planning and review meetings, can provide opportunities for teams to brainstorm new ideas and solutions. Integrating innovation into these ceremonies can help to ensure that the team is continually exploring new approaches.
#### Adapting Agile frameworks to support innovation
Agile frameworks, such as Scrum or Kanban, can be adapted to support innovation projects. Teams can create specific boards or backlogs for innovation work and establish new roles, such as an innovation champion, to lead the project.
#### Measuring the impact of innovation on team performance
It's important to measure the impact of innovation on team performance to understand its value and impact on the organization. Teams can use metrics such as customer satisfaction, productivity, and revenue growth to evaluate the success of their innovation projects.
### Conclusion
In summary, innovation is critical for Agile teams to stay competitive and succeed in today's market. Teams need to strike the right balance between daily tasks and responsibilities and exploring new ideas and approaches. By identifying the right time for innovation, creating a culture of innovation, and implementing innovation into Agile processes, teams can continuously improve and deliver value to customers.

# Why Rust is a great language for building reliable and efficient software.
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/63341e8ce3399b25c26722ce_IMGP5559.jpg)
## Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on speed, reliability, memory, safety, and concurrency.
### Introduction
Welcome to the world of Rust programming! If you've been wondering what the Rust programming language is, who uses Rust, and what is Rust used for, you've come to the right place. In this comprehensive blog post, we'll delve into the ins and outs of Rust, exploring its advantages, applications, and how it's making waves in the developer community.
### What is the Rust language
Rust is a systems programming language that has been gaining popularity among developers for its safety, concurrency, and performance features. Created by Mozilla Research and first released in 2010, Rust is designed for building secure and efficient systems. Rust emphasizes safety while maintaining a high level of performance, allowing developers to write code that's both fast and free from common bugs like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows.
### Why Rust
The programming language Rust offers several advantages over other languages, making it an attractive choice for developers looking to build reliable and efficient software.
  1. Memory safety: It enforces strict compile-time checks to prevent common memory-related errors. By using ownership and borrowing, it ensures that data is accessed by only one part of the code at a time, preventing race conditions and other concurrency bugs.
  2. Performance: It is a compiled language, which means it produces machine code that can run directly on the target hardware. This results in faster, more efficient programs compared to interpreted languages like Python.
  3. Concurrency: The built-in concurrency features, such as threads and message passing, allow for the creation of efficient and scalable applications. Unlike languages like C++ or Java, Rust ensures thread safety without the need for a garbage collector, leading to more predictable performance.
  4. Interoperability: The C-compatible FFI (Foreign Function Interface) allows it to work seamlessly with existing C and C++ libraries, making it an excellent choice for embedding in other languages or extending legacy codebases.
  5. Ecosystem: Over the years, the ecosystem has grown exponentially, providing developers with an extensive collection of libraries and frameworks, making it easier to build a wide range of applications.


### What is Rust used for
As a systems programming language, it is commonly used for low-level systems development, including operating systems, web browsers, and embedded systems, where its memory safety guarantees and efficient execution are critical. Rust's support for concurrency enables developers to create high-performance applications, such as web servers, networking tools, and distributed systems, that can effectively utilize multi-core processors and parallelism. 
In addition, Rust has seen increasing adoption in areas like game development, where its performance characteristics and safety features are highly valued, and cryptography and blockchain development, where security and reliability are of the utmost importance. 
The language's interoperability with C and C++ allows it to be integrated seamlessly into existing codebases, making it an attractive choice for extending legacy systems or embedding functionality within other programming languages. With its growing ecosystem, active community, and focus on safety and performance, Rust has proven to be a versatile and powerful tool for developers seeking to tackle a wide range of software projects.
As it gains traction and becomes more mature, the list of well-known companies who use rust language has grown. Some notable users include:
  1. Mozilla: The creators of Rust have used the language in the development of their web browser, Firefox. [The Servo project](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/), a prototype web engine written in Rust, has been integrated into Firefox for improved performance and security.
  2. Dropbox: The file hosting company uses Rust for its [core file storage system](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/), improving performance and reliability.
  3. Microsoft: Rust is being used in projects like the Azure IoT Edge runtime, as well as for research and development purposes within the company.
  4. Google: [Google's Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/languages/rust) operating system, currently under development, includes components written in Rust.


These are just a few examples of major companies that have recognized the value of Rust language uses in their projects. Numerous smaller organizations and open-source projects have also embraced the language for its safety and performance benefits.
### Rust Applications
The versatility and safety features make it well-suited for a variety of applications, including:
  1. Web development: With frameworks like [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/overview/) and [Actix](https://actix.rs/docs/), rust programmers can build fast and secure web applications.
  2. Networking: The safety and concurrency features make it an excellent choice for building networking tools and software-defined networking (SDN) components.
  3. Embedded systems: The low-level control and predictable performance make it a popular choice for embedded systems development, where resource constraints and safety are paramount.
  4. Game development: Its performance and safety features have made it attractive for game developers, with projects like the Amethyst game engine providing a solid foundation for game creation.
  5. Cryptography and blockchain: Its focus on safety and performance makes it an ideal choice for building cryptographic libraries and blockchain platforms like the Diem project mentioned earlier.

# Why We Love Flutter

## Flutter, so what's the deal here?
For a while now we've been playing around with Google's new cross platform SDK, Flutter. Recently this resulted in our first Open Source plugin, Geolocator for Flutter.
However, there's more than our usual love for open source and curiousity for new technology that makes us rather excited about Flutter. So what's the deal here?
### Cross-platfom Concepts
If you look at the available cross-platform solutions out there the basic architecture is more or less the same: use a language you can use on all supported platforms and make a bridge to the native platform API's. There's a difference between platforms that also bridge to the UI related API's (Xamarin for example) vs. the web based one's like Cordova that use a web view for the UI.
Still, in general you could say that your application works in user space, while talking to OS API's. These API's are part of the Operating System and make a developers live easy. At least that was the plan...
### Flutter Concepts
Flutter takes a different approach: it uses a language from the web ecosystem (Dart) and instead of talking to OS API's it just 'draws' directly to the screen. Why do you want to do that? Performance! Not having to deal with native API's that need to handle all kinds of different use cases, a Flutter app asks for a canvas and then draws directly onto it. This is done with a very high performance graphics rendering engine called Skia. Probably you're already familiair with Skia, because it's also used by Google's Chrome browser.
This blog is neither the time, nor the place, to discuss how Skia works but one thing is clear: a Flutter app is capable of graphics rendering performance numbers that are way beyond what you can achieve with a 'tradional' native app.
And all this combined with a beautiful, strongly typed object oriented language. Familiar with Javascript? You'll be up and running with Dart before your second cup of coffee!
### Baseflow's love for Flutter
We've been doing cross-platform for many years now. Over those years we learned to use those platforms to their maximum potential. The business case for doing cross-platform is quite simple isn't it? Well, we've been running into corner cases where, more often than not, it ended with: "maybe we should have done this with a native app".
And while it's still too early to tell (Flutter just recently left the beta stadium), we're becoming more and more convinced that Flutter might be that cross-platform solution that fits all our needs.

# Why we're excited to renew our partnership with the Dutch Innovation Days.

## Our collaboration with the Dutch Innovation Days.
### Great people & great partnerships!
We are delighted to announce the renewal of our exciting partnership with the Dutch Innovation Days! This collaboration is a result of our shared commitment to innovation and its power to drive business growth and success. Furthermore, we believe this renewed cooperation will open many doors for both organizations in terms of research & development, social impact initiatives, industry collaborations, and much more. 
As founding partners of the Dutch Innovation Days, we are proud to join forces with many exciting partners such as 4TU. ([University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/),[ Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/), [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) , and [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/)), [Demcon](https://demcon.com/), and [ESNS](https://esns.nl/nl/)! Together our goal is to drive innovative transformation initiatives within the Netherlands. This yearly gathering has proven to be a great opportunity for businesses and institutions alike to exchange ideas and explore innovative technologies – key components in staying ahead of the competition. 
The experience gained from participating in past [Dutch Innovation Days](https://did.nl/) events will help us further our mission of creating a more sustainable world through digital technology. Last year our very own developer & DJ Rick van Dijk went on stage and showcased how we can create intricate music through coding. 
Our [people first policy](https://www.baseflow.com/about) resonates strongly with the people and culture aspect of Dutch Innovation Days. Each year, the event prioritizes offering a platform to allow attendees who come from all around the world to exchange ideas and collaborate. This allows for an atmosphere full of possibilities that promote respect for diversity and inclusivity. 
Several of our Baseflow family members used their [10% free time](https://www.baseflow.com/blogs/how-to-fill-free-time) to create our very own Dr. Bibber!

We had the amazing opportunity to take part in a catwalk dinner centered around innovative robotics. With a variety of cutting-edge gadgets and technology on display, it was electrifying to see firsthand what is already possible and imagine all the potential applications for such advancements within our daily lives. It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience and we thank the hosts for giving us the chance to attend!
We look forward to collaborating with other tech leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs to develop new solutions that can help improve people’s lives around the globe. 
We look forward to building on the successes of previous partnerships while continuing to shape the future of innovation together. Join us in celebrating this new chapter, as we jointly strive to make the Netherlands a beacon of innovation worldwide! 
Thank you for being part of the journey. We can’t wait to show you what’s next.

# Yes! Baseflow is a Great Place to Work! 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/646f28e9913bc3bcd2351341_IMG_0827%20\(1\).jpg)
## And we couldn't be happier
97% of our colleagues responded, 'Yes, Baseflow is a great place to work'! And we're proud of that! This was the first time we participated, and we're excited to call ourselves a great place to work for the next coming year.
### **What is a Great Place to Work (GPTW) Certification?**
The certification is a recognition awarded to companies prioritizing employee satisfaction, engagement, and well-being. GPTW is an independent organization that evaluates workplace culture and employee experience through an assessment process. 
To evaluate companies, they use the Trust Index Employee Survey. This survey is sent out to all employees in the company, as well as an evaluation of the company's policies and practices.
Based on the responses to the statements on the survey, GPTW calculates a company's Trust Index score, which is the average score from all employee responses. You will receive a certificate if the score is higher than 70%. We scored 92% on the trust index and couldn't be happier. Every colleague has contributed to this outcome, shaping a culture where trust is more than just a word but rather a lived and shared experience.
_"One of the best things about working at Baseflow is the trust and support I receive from the company. When starting a new project, management asks, 'What do you need?' and never, 'This is how you need to do it!' That makes it an absolute joy to work at Baseflow."_**- Maurits van Beusekom (Sr. Lead Developer)**
### **Culture is our main asset**
Trust and freedom are two of our core values. And we are happy to see this reflected in the scores. Our mission is that everyone feels the authenticity to be themselves and enjoy going to work. A good work-life balance is essential for a positive workplace culture and is greatly encouraged. 
We offer flexible work hours, remote options, and unlimited vacation time. By supporting our colleagues to have a healthy balance between their work and personal lives, we can create a workplace that supports and values everyone. 
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600801ab2d5efc5ea0a393d9/646f2993171dc0fa0d76c71c_GIJS5106%20\(1\).jpg)
### **The power of People First**
The labor market is becoming increasingly tight and entirely on our playing field. To stand out, you must go along with the employees' wishes and be actively involved in being an employer. 
You know how it goes - work doesn't have to be all work, work, work. We get that! We've kicked out the old-school idea of a set number of vacation days to the curb. Everyone needs downtime, and we all recharge in our unique ways.
And hey, we're all about pursuing what makes you tick. Taking time out for personal interests can keep job satisfaction levels high and even light a creative spark that finds its way back into your work. That's why we say, "Go ahead and use 10% of your work time to do your own thing!" Whether you're jamming out on a piano, becoming fluent in French, or creating a masterpiece on canvas - we're all for it. We don't see it as a perk but a vital piece of working at Baseflow.
_"One of the many things I like at Baseflow is the open and friendly culture. People are always willing to help each other out. Everyone is approachable, always working together, and loves sharing knowledge. That creates the open and inspirational atmosphere where I want to work."_**- Danny Seigers (Sr. User Experience Designer)**
### **Better together**
Of course, we also have improvement points to work on. Growth is a continuous journey, and we're dedicated to walking this path together, always striving to enhance our work environment. We stand together in our journey towards improvement, always aspiring to make Baseflow an even greater place to work. After all, you don't create a culture at your desk by yourself; you do it together. 
 _"From the moment I started at Baseflow, I felt comfortable. Everybody is so friendly and helpful. This culture suits me. Even when something private happens, I can always rely on my colleagues. There is just a chill vibe here."_ **- Laura ter Harmsel (Project Manager)**
